The proof of the a posteriori error estimates is based on a strong stability estimate for an associated dual problem, together with the Galerkin orthogonality of the finite-element method. The strong stability estimate uses the entropy condition for the system in an essential way.},

  abstract={In many applications the quantities of interest are a series of target functionals of the solution to the governing system of partial differential equations rather than the solution itself. For example, in the field of aerodynamics, examples include the drag and lift coefficients of an airfoil immersed into a fluid, the pressure difference between the leading and trailing edges of the airfoil and point evaluations of the density or pressure on the profile of the airfoil. While traditionally these quantities are measured in wind tunnel experiments, nowadays these experiments are increasingly replaced by numerical simulations aiming to predict these quantities to a high level of accuracy.},

  abstract = {Abstract We present the Interior Penalty discontinuous Galerkin method for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Shock-capturing is used to reduce over-shoots at discontinuities and sharp gradients. This stabilization introduces artificial viscosity at places of large local residuals, but preserves conservation and Galerkin orthogonality of the DG method. Based on this discretization we derive a posteriori error estimates for the error measured in terms of arbitrary target functionals, like, e.g. the drag and lift coefficients of an airfoil immersed in a viscous or inviscid fluid. The performance of the nonlinear solution process, the a posteriori error estimation and an adaptive mesh refinement specially tailored for the accurate computation of the force coefficients are demonstrated for supersonic laminar flows around the NACA0012 airfoil.},

abstract = {Abstract In this article, we analyze the local superconvergence property of the streamline-diffusion finite-element method (SDFEM) for scalar convection-diffusion problems with dominant convection. By orienting the mesh in the streamline direction and imposing a uniformity condition on the mesh, the theoretical order of pointwise convergence is increased from O(h11/8|log h|) to O(h2|log h|). Numerical tests show that this result cannot be extended to arbitrary quasi-uniform meshes.},

  title = {Efficient computation of the Tikhonov regularization parameter by goal-oriented adaptive discretization},
  journal = {Inverse Problems},
  abstract = {Parameter identification problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) often lead to large-scale inverse problems. For their numerical solution it is necessary to repeatedly solve the forward and even the inverse problem, as it is required for determining the regularization parameter, e.g., according to the discrepancy principle in Tikhonov regularization. To reduce the computational effort, we use adaptive finite-element discretizations based on goal-oriented error estimators. This concept provides an estimate of the error in a so-called quantity of interest, which is a functional of the searched for parameter q and the PDE solution u. Based on this error estimate, the discretizations of q and u are locally refined. The crucial question for parameter identification problems is the choice of an appropriate quantity of interest. A convergence analysis of the Tikhonov regularization with the discrepancy principle on discretized spaces for q and u provides a possible answer: it shows, that in order to determine the correct regularization parameter, one has to guarantee sufficiently high accuracy in the squared residual norm-which is therefore our quantity of interest-whereas q and u themselves need not be computed precisely everywhere. This fact allows for relatively low dimensional adaptive meshes and hence for a considerable reduction of the computational effort. In this paper, we study an efficient inexact Newton algorithm for determining an optimal regularization parameter in Tikhonov regularization according to the discrepancy principle. With the help of error estimators we guide this algorithm and control the accuracy requirements for its convergence. This leads to a highly efficient method for determining the regularization parameter.}

    abstract = { Prestack seismic reflection data contain amplitudes, traveltimes, and moveout information; waveform inversion of such data has the potential to estimate attenuation levels, reflector depths and geometry, and background velocities. However, when inverting reflection data, strong nonlinearities can cause reflectors to be incorrectly imaged and can prevent background velocities from being updated. To successfully recover background velocities, previous authors have resorted to nonlinear, global search inversion techniques. We propose a two-step inversion procedure using local descent methods in which we perform alternate inversions for the reflectors and the background velocities. For our reflector inversion we exploit the efficiency of the back-propagation method when inverting for a large parameter set. For our background velocity inversion we use Newton inverse methods. During the background velocity inversions it is crucial to adaptively depth-stretch the model to preserve the vertical traveltimes. This reduces nonlinearity by largely decoupling the effects of the background velocities and reflectors on the data. Nonlinearity is further reduced by choosing to invert for slownesses and by inverting for a sparse parameter set which is partially defined using geological reflector picks. Applying our approach to shallow seismic data from the North Sea collected over a gas-sand deposit, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to estimate both the geometry and internal velocity of a significant velocity structure not present in the initial model. Over successive iterations, the use of adaptive depth stretching corrects the pull-down of the base of the gas sand. Vertical background velocity gradients are also resolved. For an insignificant extra cost the acoustic attenuation parameter Q is included in the inversion scheme. The final attenuation tomogram contains realistic values of Q for the expected lithologies and for the effect of partial fluid saturation associated with a shallow bright spot. The attenuation image may also indicate the presence of fracturing. }

  abstract = {Challenges remain in imaging fast biological activities through whole body using fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT). We propose and analyze three full angle FDOT systems with different beam-forming illuminations (BF-FDOT), including line illumination (L-FDOT), area illumination (A-FDOT), and multiple-points illumination (MP-FDOT). Singular value analysis and experimental validation are used to optimize the experimental parameters in terms of hardware design, data collection and utilization. Comparisons are made on the system performance between L-FDOT and the conventional point illumination based full angle FDOT system (P-FDOT) with both numerical simulation and phantom experiment. We demonstrate that at least three cycles of projections are needed for P-FDOT to achieve comparable whole body image quality with L-FDOT. We also compare these three BF-FDOT systems and further discuss how these optimized parameters can be employed to improve spatial and temporal performances within current computational capacities, and guide the design of the BF-FDOT systems.},

  abstract = {Downhole inflow control devices allow for the flexible operation of nonconventional wells. In this paper, a method for determining the optimal performance of smart wells, i.e., wells containing downhole inflow control devices, is presented. The method entails the use of a gradient-based optimization technique in conjunction with a reservoir simulator. The optimization accounts for uncertain geology as well as the risk of failure of the control devices. A decision analysis approach is presented to determine whether or not to deploy smart completions in light of these uncertainties. The overall optimization technique is applied to several example problems involving geological models with multiple geostatistical realizations and with different reliability scenarios for the control devices. It is shown that there is significant variation in the level of improvement attainable using inflow control devices and that this improvement varies with both the valve reliability and the particular geological realization. Decision-making techniques are used to quantify the benefits obtained using optimized smart wells under different risk attitudes.}

  keywords = {Optimal control, Bang-bang control, Singular arcs, Reservoir flooding},
  abstract = {Over the past few years, dynamic optimization of reservoir flooding using optimal control theory has received significant attention. Various studies have shown that dynamic (time-varying) injection and production settings can yield a higher Net Present Value (NPV) than conventional reactive settings. In these studies, the optimization procedure itself is always gradient-based, where the gradients are obtained with an adjoint formulation. However, the shape of the optimal injection and production settings is generally not known beforehand. The main contribution of this paper is to investigate why and under what conditions reservoir flooding problems can be expected to have bang-bang (on-off) optimal solutions. A major practical advantage of bang-bang controls is that they can be implemented with simple on-off valves. Furthermore, there are sufficient optimality conditions that are tailor-made for bang-bang solutions, meaning we can actually check whether a solution is locally optimal or not. These results are illustrated by a water flooding example of a 3-dimensional reservoir in a fluvial depositional environment, modeled with 18.553 grid blocks. The valve settings of 8 injection and 4 production wells are optimized over the life of the reservoir, with the objective to maximize NPV. It turns out that optimal settings are sometimes bang-bang, and sometimes bang-bang in combination with so-called singular arcs. For the latter situations, however, bang-bang solutions are found that are only slightly suboptimal.}

  abstract = {SUMMARY This article describes the extension of the arbitrary high-order Discontinuous Galerkin (ADER-DG) method to treat locally varying polynomial degress of the basis functions, so-called p-adaptivity, as well as locally varying time steps that may be different from one element to another. The p-adaptive version of the scheme is useful in complex 3-D models with small-scale features which have to be meshed with reasonably small elements to capture the necessary geometrical details of interest. Using a constant high polynomial degree of the basis functions in the whole computational domain can lead to an unreasonably high CPU effort since good spatial resolution at the surface may be already obtained by the fine mesh. Therefore, it can be more adequate in some cases to use a lower order method in the small elements to reduce the CPU effort without loosing much accuracy. To further increase computational efficiency, we present a new local time stepping (LTS) algorithm. For usual explicit time stepping schemes the element with the smallest time step resulting from the stability criterion of the method will dictate its time step to all the other elements of the computational domain. In contrast, by using local time stepping, each element can use its optimal time step given by the local stability condition. Our proposed LTS algorithm for ADER-DG is very general and does not need any temporal synchronization between the elements. Due to the ADER approach, accurate time interpolation is automatically provided at the element interfaces such that the computational overhead is very small and such that the method maintains the uniform high order of accuracy in space and time as in the usual ADER-DG schemes with a globally constant time step. However, the LTS ADER-DG method is computationally much more efficient for problems with strongly varying element size or material parameters since it allows to reduce the total number of element updates considerably. This holds especially for unstructured tetrahedral meshes that contain strongly degenerate elements, so-called slivers. We show numerical convergence results and CPU times for LTS ADER-DG schemes up to sixth order in space and time on irregular tetrahedral meshes containing elements of very different size and also on tetrahedral meshes containing slivers. Further validation of the algorithm is provided by results obtained for the layer over half-space (LOH.1) benchmark problem proposed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center. Finally, we present a realistic application on earthquake modelling and ground motion prediction for the alpine valley of Grenoble.},

abstract = {Abstract Flow in the Earth's mantle causes the preferred orientation of crystals called lattice/crystal preferred orientation (LPO or CPO). This preferred orientation is one of the main reasons why seismic anisotropy is observed. Seismic anisotropy observations could therefore be used to constrain the mantle flow in geodynamic models through tracking CPO evolution, and computing the resulting elastic tensor and the anisotropy predicted at the surface. Even though there are many types of CPO models, only a few studies include CPO calculations due to the complexity and computational cost. Here, we implemented an extended version of the CPO model D-Rex into the open-source community geodynamics code ASPECT. We show that the implementation is correct, how to use it, and that it is feasible and important to use in large 3D models. We also show that it is important to calculate CPO, especially for models focusing on plate boundary of smaller scale flow because the resulting fast axis directions can greatly deviate from the flow direction. The added infrastructure will also allow for future enhancement, testing, and even replacement of the CPO model.},
