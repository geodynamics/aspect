## Principal developers

ASPECT is being developed by a large, collaborative, and inclusive
community. This community is led by a group of *Principal Developers*
who are active in developing code, reviewing code, contributing to
the documentation, helping users on the online forums and in person, and
in many other visible and invisible ways. The current ASPECT principal
developers are:

* Wolfgang Bangerth (Colorado State University, USA)
* Juliane Dannberg (GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, Germany)
* Menno Fraters (University of Graz, Austria)
* Rene Gassmoeller (GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, Germany)

* Timo Heister (Clemson University, USA)
* Bob Myhill (University of Bristol, UK)
* John Naliboff (New Mexico Tech, USA)
* Cedric Thieulot (Utrecht University, Netherlands)
