About
-----

ASPECT is a code to simulate convection in Earth's mantle and elsewhere.
It has grown from a pure mantle-convection code into a tool for many
geodynamic applications including applications for inner core convection,
lithospheric scale deformation, two-phase flow, and numerical methods development.
The project is supported by CIG (http://geodynamics.org).



Installation instructions
-------------------------

The steps to install the necessary dependencies and ASPECT itself are described
in the Installation instructions section of the ASPECT
[manual](http://www.math.clemson.edu/~heister/manual.pdf). If you encounter
problems during the installation, please consult our
[wiki](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/wiki) for typical installation
problems or specific instructions for MacOS users, before asking your question
on the mailing list.



Running and extending ASPECT
----------------------------

Instructions on how to run and extend, as well as on how to interpret the
output of ASPECT can also be found in the ASPECT
[manual](http://www.math.clemson.edu/~heister/manual.pdf). This manual also
discusses the structure of the source code.

For getting started, you can also watch our online
[tutorial](https://geodynamics.org/cig/events/calendar/2016-cig-all-hands-meeting/aspect-tutorial/tutorial/).



Contributing to ASPECT
----------------------

ASPECT is a community project that lives by the participation of its
members — i.e., including you! It is our goal to build an inclusive
and participatory community so we are happy that you are interested in
participating! We have collected a set of guidelines and advice on how
to get involved in the community and keep them in the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
file in ASPECT's repository.
