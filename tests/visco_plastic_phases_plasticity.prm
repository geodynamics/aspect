# Copy of visco_plastic_phases.prm, but tests different plasticity parameters for different phases.
# Above the 50km depth phase transition we set 10MPa and 20 degrees for the cohesion and internal friction angle.
# Below the 50km depth phase transition plastic yielding is switched off by setting a high cohesion of 1e20, and friction changes to 0.
# This is visible in the visualization output.
