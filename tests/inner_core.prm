# A simple setup for convection the inner core. See the
# manual, Section Cookbooks/Geophysical setups/Inner core convection
# for more information. Changing the Rayleigh number Ra
# and the resistance to phase change P will change the mode
# of inner core convection between translation, plume convection
# or no convection.

# Setup and equations are given in: Deguen, Alboussiere,
