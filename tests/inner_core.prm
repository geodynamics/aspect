# A simple setup for convection the inner core. See the
# manual, Section Cookbooks/Geophysical setups/Inner core convection 
# for more information. Changing the Rayleigh number Ra 
# and the resistance to phase change P will change the mode
# of inner core convection between translation, plume convection
# or no convection.

# Setup and equations are given in: Deguen, Alboussiere, 
# and Cardin (2013), Thermal convection in Earth’s inner core 
# with phase change at its boundary. GJI, 194, 1310-133.
