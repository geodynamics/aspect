# This test is used to check if the shear heating
# of melt, in particular advective transport of heat due
# to melt migration, is calculated correctly.
# There is no in- or outflux of solid material, but melt
# is allowed to flow in freely, so that it moves upwards
# with a constant velocity determined by its buoyancy.
# Hence there is no shear of the solid material, but there
# is dissipation due to the segregation of melt
# \eta_f porosity^2 / permeability * (u_f - u_s)^2,
# and heat is advected by melt migration:
# porosity \rho_f C_p (u_f \cdot \nabla T).
#
# With the material properties in this benchmark, both heating
# rates should be the same (0.1), and the temperature should stay
# in equilibrium.
