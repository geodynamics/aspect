# Initial temperature field
# Typical continental geotherm based equations 4-6 from Chapman 1986 (Geol. Soc. Lon.):
#   T(z) = Tt + (qt/k)*z - (A*z**2)/(2*k)    (eq 4)
#   Tb = Tt + (qt/k)*dz - (A*dz**2)/(2*k)    (eq 5)
#   qb = qt - A*dz                           (eq 6)
#     T: Temperature, Ts: Layer surface temperature, Tb: layer basal temperature,
#     qs: Layer surface heat flux, qb: Layer basal heat flux, A = heat production,
#     dz: Layer thickness, k: thermal conductivity
# The initial constraints are:
#   Crust surface temperature (Tsc) = 273 K
#   Crust surface heat flow   (qsc) = 0.07 W/m^2
#   Crust heat production      (Ac) = 1.5e-6 W/m^3
#   Crust thickness           (dzu) = 30.3 m
#   Mantle heat production     (Am) = 0. W/m^3
#   Mantle thickness          (dzm) = 70.e3
#   Thermal conductivity        (K) = 2.5 W/(m K)
# These constraints allow us to calculate the following values:
#   qbc = qsc - A*dzc = 0.07 - 1.5e-6*30.e3 = 0.025
#   Tbc = Tsc + (qsc/k)*dzc - (A*dzc**2)/(2*k) =
#         273. + (0.07/2.5)*30.e3 - (1.5e-6 * 30.e3**2)/(2.*2.5) = 843
#   qsm = qbc = 0.025
#   Tsm = Tbc = 843
#   qbm = qsm - A*dzm = 0.025 - 0.*70.e3 = 0.025
#   Tbm = Tsm + (qts/k)*dzs - (A*dzm**2)/(2*k) =
#         843. + (0.025/2.5)*30.e3 - (0. * 70.e3**2)/(2.*2.5) = 1543
