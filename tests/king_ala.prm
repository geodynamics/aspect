# There are a number of models with the 'function' model

# for the temperature. The model we choose is called 'box' and

subsection Model settings

# The final part is to specify what ASPECT should do with the

# domain, and to generate graphical output files for later
# visualization. These output files are created every time
# a time step crosses time points separated by 0.01. Given
# our start time (zero) and final time (0.5) this means that
# we will obtain 50 output files.
