## This parameter file tests the implementation
# of grain boundary sliding (GBS) rheology in ASPECT, based on the analytical
# creep law from Goldsby & Kohlstedt (2001): 
#
#   η = 0.5 * A^(-1/n) * d^m * exp[(E + PV)/(nRT)] * (ε̇)^{(1-n)/n}
#
# where:
#   η is the effective viscosity,
#   A is the prefactor,
#   n is the stress exponent,
#   m is the grain size exponent,
#   d is the grain size,
#   E is the activation energy,
#   V is the activation volume,
#   P is pressure,
#   R is the gas constant,
#   T is temperature,
#   ε̇ is the second invariant of the deviatoric strain rate tensor.
#
# This test imposes a constant shear velocity field that produces a uniform
# strain rate of ε̇ = 1.0 x 10^-15 s⁻¹ throughout the domain. The temperature is fixed
# at 263 K, and the grain size is set to 26 μm. These material parameters are chosen
# to represent deformation in ice 1.
#
# All other creep mechanisms (e.g., diffusion creep, dislocation creep,
# Peierls creep) are effectively disabled to isolate the GBS response.
#
# The viscosity field output from ASPECT is 3.805e+15 Pa s.
# This matches the analytical solution of 3.81e+15 Pa·s 
# computed in Python using the following code:
#
# import numpy as np
#
# # Constants
# A = 3.9e-19              # 1/Pa^n m^m /s
# n = 1.8
# m = 1.4
# d = 26e-6                # m
# E = 49000                # J/mol
# V = 13e-6                # m^3/mol
# R = 8.314                # J/mol/K
# T = 263                  # K
# edot = 1e-15             # 1/s

# # Pressure in Pascals at mid-depth (P = rho * g * (H - y)). 0 in this case for simplicity.
# y = 0.5
# P = 0

# eta = 0.5 * A**(-1/n) * d**m * np.exp((E + P * V) / (n * R * T)) * edot**((1 - n) / n)
# print(f"Analytical viscosity at y={y}: {eta:.2e} Pa·s")
