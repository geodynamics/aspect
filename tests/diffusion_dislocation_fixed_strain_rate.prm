# This model has a box geometry where simple shear is induced by constant velocity
# along the bottom and top boundaries. Diffusion dislocation creep laws corresponding
# to the model of Hirth and Kohlstedt for dry olivine are used, and the viscosity is
# calculated at the first time step for a constant temperature of 1600 K.
# The analytical solution for the viscosity with the given parameters is 5.81735e17 Pas.
# Note that the strain rate output by aspect is the *norm*, but the model itself uses
# the square root of the second invariant. For reference, edot_norm = sqrt(2*edot_ii).
# The depth average output contains viscosity output, and so provides the required test.
