# This is a relatively realistic compressible model setup.
# There is no simple analytical solution to it, it is rather
# intended to serve as a comparison for more complicated
# material models, which should be able to reproduce it.
# The material model used here is already tested by
# simple_compressibility_iterated_stokes.
# Currently there is the steinberger-compressible test
# reproducing this test.
