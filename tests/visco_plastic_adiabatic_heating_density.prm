# A test with the visco_plastic material model to ensure
# that the multicomponent_incompressible EOS module
# uses the adiabatic temperature to compute density when
# adiabatic heating is turned on. The formula specified
# in this test follows the Extended Boussinesq approximation.
# The initial temperature throughout the model is equal to
# the adiabatic temperature profile. As a result, the
# the absolute density should be constant throughout the
# model and equal to the background values specified in
# material model (3300 kg m^-3):
#   density = background_density * ( 1 - thermal_expansivity * (temperature - reference_temperature)),
# where the reference_temperature is the depth-dependent
# adiabatic temperature. If adiabatic heating was not
# used in the model, then the reference temperature
# would be the constant value specified in the material
# model (273 K), which would produce different density values.
