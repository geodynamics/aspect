# A testcase that demonstrates that interpolating material model
# outputs into the temperature field works, and that this
# temperature is actually being used to compute the material
# properties.
#
# The property copied into the temperature field has a large
# value in the upper half of the box and a low value in the lower
# half of the box. If viscosities are being computed correctly,
# then the strain rate should be much larger in the top half.
