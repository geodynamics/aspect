# This test checks viscoelastic stress buildup with a
# constant strain rate and an elastic time step equal
# to a user-specified constant elastic time step. This
# fixed elastic time step is double the numerical time step.
# Viscoelastic stresses (sigma_xx, sigma_yy, sigma_xy)
# are tracked with compositional fields. The parameter
# file is derived from the 2D viscoelastic_stress_build-up
# benchmark with modifications to the resolution, end time,
# material properties and postprocessors.
