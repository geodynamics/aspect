# A testcase that demonstrates melt transport with a compactible matrix,
# and incompressible matrix and fluid. Boundary conditions for the
# velocity and fluid pressure as well as porosity initial conditions
# are applied as described by the derived analytical solution,
# which can be found in the manuscript on compressible melt transport
# in ASPECT.
# We compute these material properties in a new material model, which
# is implemented in the .cc file, together with a postprocessor to calculate
# the error and a new pressure boundary condition.
# An important feature of this setup is the high porosity vein that
# runs through the model and we use it to demonstrate the effectiveness
# of adaptive mesh refinement.
