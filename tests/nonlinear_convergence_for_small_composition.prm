# Listing of Parameters
# ---------------------
# This test demonstrates that the nonlinear solver can not converge
# if the reaction term depends on the Stokes solution (in this case
# the velocity divergence) and the right-hand side of the compositional
# field advection equation is zero or very small otherwise, as long as
# the Stokes solution still changes (the number of linear Stokes solver
# iterations is not equal to zero).
# As soon as the Stokes system is not solved any more, the nonlinear
# residual drops to a very small number.
