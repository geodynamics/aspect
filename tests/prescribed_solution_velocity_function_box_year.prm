# This test verifies implementation of prescribed solutions interface.
# It sets up a 2D convection problem in a rectangular box with 
# prescribed velocity conditions. A prescribed velocity function is 
# applied that varies with space and time to set the flow field.
# The time unit "year" is used in this test instead of "seconds"

# At the top, we define the number of space dimensions we would like to
# work in:
set Dimension                              = 2

# There are several global variables that have to do with what
# time system we want to work in and what the end time is. We
# also designate an output directory.

# Then come a number of sections that deal with the setup

# set the parameters that are specific to this particular
# model.

# The next section deals with the initial conditions for the

# There are a number of models with the 'function' model
# a generic one that allows us to enter the actual initial
# conditions in the form of a formula that can contain
# constants. We choose a linear temperature profile that
# matches the boundary conditions defined below plus
# a small perturbation. The variables in this equation are
# described below, and it is important to note that in many
# cases the values correspond to other model parameters
# defined elsewhere. As such, if these model parameters are
# changed, the values below will also need to be adjusted.

# of the box geometry. In our case, we choose something that is
# heated from below and cooled from above, whereas all other
# parts of the boundary are insulated (i.e., no heat flux through
# these boundaries; this is also often used to specify symmetry
# boundaries).

# domain, and to generate graphical output files for later
# visualization. These output files are created every time
# a time step crosses time points separated by 0.01. Given
# our start time (zero) and final time (0.5) this means that
# we will obtain 50 output files.
