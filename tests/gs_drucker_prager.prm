# In this test, a velocity field is prescribed that represents
# simple shear with respect to the model's y-axis. This setup generates
# output that describes the material model's response to a range
# of stress conditions.

# The yield strength is
# cohesion * cos(phi) + pressure * sin(phi) = 50 MPa + 0.5 * pressure
# = 50 MPa + 0.5 * 1e6 * x

# The (non-yield) stress in the model is
# 2 * strain_rate * viscosity = 1e6 * y

# This means the transition from yielding to non-yielding (expressed by
# the plastic_yielding variable in the graphical output) should start
# at x=0, y=50 and end at x=200, y=150.
