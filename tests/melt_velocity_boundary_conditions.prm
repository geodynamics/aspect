# Test for the boundary conditions for the melt velocity 
# (which can not be set explicitly, but are implied by the boundary
# conditions for the fluid pressure gradient) with melt transport = on 
# and a constant nonzero porosity at the top boundary.
# The boundary conditions are set in a way that no melt should flow in 
# or out.
#
# The test is similar to free_surface_blob_melt, except that melt
# has a nonzero initial condition, and there is no free surface. 
# We test if the boundary conditions for melt are set correctly
# (no melt flowing in/out at the top surface) by checking if the
# velocity field at the upper boundary is small (it should converge to
# zero with increasing resolution close to the upper surface).
