# A testcase for the "shear stress" visualization postprocessor. It solves the
# equations on a box with Dirichlet boundary conditions equal to
# (z,0), which then is also the velocity everywhere. This yields
# a constant strain rate [[0,1/2],[1/2,0]]
#
# the shear stress is then simply this tensor times -2*eta and we set
# eta=42 below.
