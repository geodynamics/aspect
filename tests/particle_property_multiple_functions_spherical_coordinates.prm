# This test is identical to particle_property_multiple_functions.prm
# but with spherical coordinates.
#
# A description of the van Keken et al. benchmark using smooth initial
# conditions instead of the discontinuous ones in van-keken-discontinuous.prm.
# See the manual for more information. This test adds particles to the cookbook
# parameter file with two particle properties defined by two different functions.
# One is a discontinuous function and the other is a smooth function.

# MPI: 2
