# test checkpoint/resume.

# This test is controlled via the plugin in checkpoint_03.cc. The plugin will
# first execute ASPECT with this .prm and write the output into
# output1.tmp/. This will generate a snapshot that is then resumed from. The
# output for this second run will be written into output2.tmp/. Finally,
# output files will be copied into the main output folder for comparison.

# based on checkpoint_01.prm, but extended by particle serialization
