# This is a test for the latent heat release and consumption
# in the melt boukare material model. The initial temperature
# is set to a value that is out of equilibrium with the initial
# porosity in the model, specifically, it is set so high that
# the energy released by reducing the temperature to the solidus
# allows for melting of approximately 10% of the material. This
# means that the steady-state melt fraction at the end of the
# model run should be 0.1.
# The test also outputs the bulk composition to make sure it is
# conserved (it should be 0.001).
