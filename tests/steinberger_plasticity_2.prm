# This is a test for Steinberger material model with Drucker-Prager Plasticity
# The model is set up with a prescribed velocity field. Given the model setup, 
# yielding is expected to happen at places where pressure is lower than 2 GPa
# (~50 km depth).
# yield stress = P*sind(0.5) + 8e7*cosd(0.5) Pa
# stress second invariant = 1e8 Pa
# yielding if yield stress <= stress second invariant
