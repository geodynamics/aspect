# Listing of Parameters
# ---------------------
# This test checks if including melt transport in a simulation, 
# but setting the porosity to 0, gives the same results as running
# the simulation without melt transport.
# 
# Results are the same up to the first three digits of time step size
# and min/max/mass of compositional fields. 
# 
# Differences can be checked by setting 'Include melt transport'
# to false.
