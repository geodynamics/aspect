# This test checks that the correct averaging is done by the
# multicomponent compressible material model. In this test,
# two materials are chosen, with constant mass fractions of 0.5.
# At the reference temperature (273 K) and at 0 GPa pressure,
# materials 1 and 2 have densities of 2000 kg/m^3 and 3000 kg/m^3,
# which equates to volume fractions of 0.6 and 0.4.
#
# The outputs for the properties at 0 GPa and 273 K are then:
# Density: 2400 kg/m^3 (volume averaged, 0.6*2000 + 0.4*3000)
# Thermal_expansivity: 2.4e-5 (volume averaged, 0.6*2e-5 + 0.4*3e-5)
# Isochoric specific_heat: 1500 (mass averaged, 0.5*1000 + 0.5*2000)
# Viscosity: 2.4e20 (arithmetically volume averaged, 0.6*2.e20 + 0.4*3.e20)
# Thermal conductivity: 2.4 (volume averaged, 0.6*2 + 0.4*3)
# Isobaric specific heat: 1527.3 (mass averaged, 0.5*1027.3 + 0.5*2027.3)
# (because isobaric specific heat Cp = Cv + T*alpha^2/(rho*beta_T))
#
# At other pressure-temperature conditions, the volume
# fractions change despite the mass fractions remaining constant.
