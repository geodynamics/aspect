# This test checks if the postprocessor 'melt fraction' works as
# intended. The visualization output is then a p-T-diagram of
# the melt fraction (which, in this case, is a simple linear relation)
# with the temperature ranging from 1000°C to 1900°C on the x axis
# and the pressure ranging from 0 GPa to 8 GPa on the y axis.

# The data can be plotted in gnuplot using:
# set view map
# splot "file1" using 5:6:7 with points pointtype 5 pointsize 1 palette,
#       "file2" using 5:6:7 with points pointtype 5 pointsize 1 palette

# MPI: 2

set Dimension                              = 2

# There are several global variables that have to do with what
# time system we want to work in and what the end time is. We
# also designate an output directory.

# Then come a number of sections that deal with the setup
# of the problem to solve. The first one deals with the
# geometry of the domain within which we want to solve.
# The sections that follow all have the same basic setup
# where we select the name of a particular model (here,
# the box geometry) and then, in a further subsection,
# set the parameters that are specific to this particular
# model.

# The next section deals with the initial conditions for the
# temperature (there are no initial conditions for the
# velocity variable since the velocity is assumed to always
# be in a static equilibrium with the temperature field).
# There are a number of models with the 'function' model
# a generic one that allows us to enter the actual initial
# conditions in the form of a formula that can contain
# constants. We choose a linear temperature profile that
# matches the boundary conditions defined below plus
# a small perturbation:

# The following two sections describe first the
# direction (vertical) and magnitude of gravity and the
# material model (i.e., density, viscosity, etc). We have
# discussed the settings used here in the introduction to
# this cookbook in the manual already.

  end
end

# The settings above all pertain to the description of the
# continuous partial differential equations we want to solve.
# The following section deals with the discretization of
# this problem, namely the kind of mesh we want to compute
# on. We here use a globally refined mesh without
# adaptive mesh refinement.

# The final part is to specify what ASPECT should do with the
# solution once computed at the end of every time step. The
# process of evaluating the solution is called `postprocessing'
# and we choose to compute velocity and temperature statistics,
# statistics about the heat flux through the boundaries of the
# domain, and to generate graphical output files for later
# visualization. These output files are created every time
# a time step crosses time points separated by 0.01. Given
# our start time (zero) and final time (0.5) this means that
# we will obtain 50 output files.
