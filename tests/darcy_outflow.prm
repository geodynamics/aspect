# This test defines an initial block of porosity implaced in a solid within a 2D cartesian box.
# Because the porosity composition is less dense than the solid, the porosity will rise to the 
# surface of the model and flow out of the top of the box. This tests the implementation of 
# composition dependent outflow boundary conditions for when a composition is advected with the 
# Darcy field advection method.
