# It sets up a 2D convection problem in a spherical chunk with

# applied that varies with space and time to set the flow field.

# the converting of units. In addition, the "Use spherical unit vectors" 
# is set to true in this test so that the The first entry of the 
# velocity aligns with r direction and the second entry aligns with phi direction

# conditions in the form of a formula that can contain
# constants. We choose a linear temperature profile that
# matches the boundary conditions defined below plus
# a small perturbation. The variables in this equation are

# cases the values correspond to other model parameters
# defined elsewhere. As such, if these model parameters are
