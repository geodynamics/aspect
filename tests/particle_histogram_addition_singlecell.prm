# This is an extremely basic test case for particle addition using a histogram.
# The test generates three particles from an ASCII file, each in a separate corner of the cell.
# The result of this test should be to generate a new particle in the corner of the 
# cell which did not already have a particle generated from the ASCII file. This is to make
# sure that the histogram method is generating particles in the histogram "bucket" which
# has the least particles.
