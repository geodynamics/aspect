# This parameter file tests the adiabatic initial conditions
# implemented for the chunk geometry.
# The 2D chunk geometry has a 60 degree opening angle.
# A 100 K spherical perturbation of radius 400 km is applied
# in the middle of the inner boundary.
#
# This test is based on adiabatic_initial_conditions.prm
