# This test is used to check if the adiabatic heating
# of melt is calculated correctly.
# The material is upwelling with a constant velocity
# and without conduction of heat, so that the steady state
# of the model is an adiabatic temperature profile, and
# the temperature should not change over time.
#
# The testcase is very similar to the adiabatic_heating
# test, but melt transport and the adiabatic heat of melt
# heating model are enabled. There is 100% melt in the model,
# and melt has a different density than the solid (so that
# melt an solid velocities are different). However, the melt
# should still upwell adiabatically, so temperature should
# not change.

# At the top, we define the number of space dimensions we would like to
# work in:
set Dimension                              = 2
set Nonlinear solver scheme                = iterated Advection and Stokes

# There are several global variables that have to do with what
# time system we want to work in and what the end time is.
