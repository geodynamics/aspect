# This test checks that we do not divide by zero when computing
# the conduction timestep in a model, where the thermal conductivity is
# set to zero. We simply use the convection timestep in this case
# (or fall back to the original default, when the velocity is zero as well).
# Otherwise this test is identical to constant_composition_convergence.prm
