# This test verifies the input functionality of the bedrock incision coefficient (Kf) in the Fastscape plugin.
# Kf can be defined either as a constant or as a time-dependent 2D function.
# In this test, Kf starts at 1e-6 across the domain, and the right side of the domain increases to 1e-4
# between 250 kyr and 500 kyr.
# The results can be visualized in the Fastscape topography VTK output file.
# Enable if: ASPECT_WITH_FASTSCAPE
