# This is a copy of Steinberger compressible test,
# but it uses two tiny property tables with constant properties to
# test the averaging schemes for the material properties.
# The constant mass fraction of material_2 is 0.5, which for densities of
# 2000 kg/m^3 and 3000 kg/m^3 equates to a volume fraction of 0.4.
#
# The correct outputs for the properties are then:
# volume fraction of phase A: 0.5 (volume averaged, 0.6*0.5 + 0.4*0.5)
# volume fraction of phase B: 0.3 (volume averaged, 0.6*0.5 + 0.4*0.0)
# volume fraction of phase C: 0.2 (volume averaged, 0.6*0.0 + 0.4*0.5)
# Seismic Vs: 5.942027625961722 (VRH average of 6 and 6)
# Seismic Vp: 7.922703501282297 (VRH average of 8 and 8)
# Density: 2400 kg/m^3 (volume averaged, 0.6*2000 + 0.4*3000)
# Thermal_expansivity: 2.4e-5 (volume averaged, 0.6*2e-5 + 0.4*3e-5)
# Specific_heat: 1500 (mass averaged, 0.5*1000 + 0.5*2000)
