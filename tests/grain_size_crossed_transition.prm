# A test for the grain size material model to see if the grain
# size is reset correctly after crossing a phase transition.
# The model contains a phase transition in the middle at 50 km depth
# where the grain size is reset to 1 mm (from the initial value of
# 2 mm). The vertical component of the velocity prescribed at the top
# and bottom boundary is a sine wave, so that in the left half of
# the model, grain size is reset above the transition, and in the
# right half it is reset below the phase transition.
