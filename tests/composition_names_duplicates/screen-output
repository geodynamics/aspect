   Postprocessing:


An exception happened on MPI process <0> while running the visualization postprocessor <N6aspect11Postprocess27VisualizationPostprocessors18MaterialPropertiesILi2EEE>: 

An error occurred in file <visualization.cc> in function
(line in output replaced by default.sh script)
The violated condition was: 
    iterator_and_success.second == true
Additional information: 
    The output variable <density> already exists in the list of output variables. Make sure there is no duplication in the names of visualization output variables, otherwise output files may be corrupted.
