# This is a benchmark to check that the 'Material statistics'
# postprocessor works correctly. It creates a model with lateral
# flow. The density in the model is constant and the volume is known,
# so it is easy to compute the expected output. Over time material
# with a different density flows in until it fills the whole domain.
