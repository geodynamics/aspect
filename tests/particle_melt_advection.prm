# This is a test for the melt particle functionality.
# It is the same setup as in the rising_melt_blob test,
# with added passive particles that move with the melt
# velocity. The test checks if the particles are moving
# correctly, and if they are correctly labelled with the
# property 'melt presence' if the porosity is above a
# threshold at their location.
