# This is the most difficult case of the Spiegelman benchmark. The
# goal of this test is to show that the linear Newton solver fails
# when the the matrix becomes non Symmetric Positive Definite, and 
# is safed by forcing the matrix to be SPD. In the next timestep 
# the stabilization is reset to the user defined values.
