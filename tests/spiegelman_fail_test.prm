# This is the most difficult case of the Spiegelman benchmark. The
# goal of this test is to show that the linear Newton solver fails
# when the matrix becomes non Symmetric Positive Definite, and
# is safed by forcing the matrix to be SPD. In the next timestep
# the stabilization is reset to the user defined values.
