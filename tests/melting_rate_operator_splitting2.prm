# This is a test for the melting rate functionality,
# and it is the same as the melting_rate_operator_splitting
# test case, except that is uses the melt global instead
# of the melt simple material model. This also means that
# we have to change the absolute temperature values, as
# this material model has a fixed temperature difference
# of 500 K between solidus and liquidus.

# We set the temperature in such a way that the initial
# equilibrium melt fraction would be 2e-3, but due to
# latent heat effects, the temperature gets reduced and
# the final melt fraction should be 1e-3.
# Likewise, the temperature should be reduced from 1001
# to 1000.5.
