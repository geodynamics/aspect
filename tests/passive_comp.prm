# Listing of Parameters
# ---------------------
# In computations, the time step $k$ is chosen according to $k = c \min_K
# \frac{h_K}{\|u\|_{\infty,K} p_T}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of cell $K$,
# and the denominator is the maximal magnitude of the velocity on cell $K$
# times the polynomial degree $p_T$ of the temperature discretization. The
# dimensionless constant $c$ is called the CFL number in this program. For
# time discretizations that have explicit components, $c$ must be less than a
# constant that depends on the details of the time discretization and that is
# no larger than one. On the other hand, for implicit discretizations such as
# the one chosen here, one can choose the time step as large as one wants (in
# particular, one can choose $c>1$) though a CFL number significantly larger
# than one will yield rather diffusive solutions. Units: None.
set CFL number                             = 1.0

# The end time of the simulation. Units: years if the 'Use years in output
# instead of seconds' parameter is set; seconds otherwise.

# A flag indicating whether the computation should be resumed from a
# previously saved state (if true) or start from scratch (if false).

# When computing results for mantle convection simulations, it is often
# difficult to judge the order of magnitude of results when they are stated in
# MKS units involving seconds. Rather, some kinds of results such as
# velocities are often stated in terms of meters per year (or, sometimes,
# centimeters per year). On the other hand, for non-dimensional computations,
# one wants results in their natural unit system as used inside the code. If
# this flag is set to 'true' conversion to years happens; if it is 'false', no
# such conversion happens.
