############### Parameters describing the model
# We consider a 2D box of 40x10 km of which the elements are of unit aspect ratio.
# Temperature plays no role in this model.
# We prescribe a horizontal velocity (extension) on the vertical
# boundaries, but leave the vertical component free.
# To the bottom boundary we prescribe the same horizontal velocity,
# the vertical velocity component is set to zero. The top boundary is open.
# We use a Drucker Prager failure criterion.

############### Parameters describing what to do with the solution
# The final section allows us to choose which postprocessors to
# run at the end of each time step.
# We select to compute some statistics about the
# velocity field and the mass flux through the boundaries.
# As we prescribe an outflow of 2e-11 m/s on both vertical boundaries
# the VRMS should be on that order. The max velocity will be a little
# higher, because the outflow will be balanced by an inflow
# through the top boundary over a smaller boundary length.
# For the given density and outflow velocity, a boundary
# mass flux of v * L * rho = 2e-11  * 10000 * 2700 = 5.4e-4 kg/s
# is expected for each vertical boundary,
# compensated by a influx of 1.08e-3 kg/s through the top.
