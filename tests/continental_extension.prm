#### 
# This test is based on the Continental Extension Cookbook
# There, the initial temperature is computed through a
# somewhat cumbersome function specified in the input file. 
# With the continental geotherm plugin, one only has to 
# specify the boundary temperature constraints and layer
# thicknesses of the upper crust, lower crust and mantle
# lithosphere. Other parameters such as layer densities
# are read from other sections in the input file, ensuring
# consistency between the parameters set for the initial
# temperature and those in the material model and compositional
# heating plugins.

#### Parameters describing the model

# Model geometry (40x10 km, 10 km spacing)
subsection Geometry model
  set Model name = box
  subsection Box
    set X repetitions = 40
    set Y repetitions = 10
    set X extent      = 400e3
    set Y extent      = 100e3
  end
end

# Mesh refinement specifications (no mesh refinement, 
# but the coarse mesh is already 40x10, see above)
subsection Mesh refinement
  set Initial adaptive refinement        = 0
  set Initial global refinement          = 0
  set Time steps between mesh refinement = 0
end


# Number and names of compositional fields
# The four compositional fields represent the upper crust, lower crust, mantle
# and a 'seed' placed in the mantle to help localize deformation.
subsection Compositional fields
  set Number of fields = 4
  set Names of fields = upper_crust, lower_crust, lithospheric_mantle, seed
end


# Temperature boundary conditions
# Top and bottom (fixed) temperatures are consistent with the initial temperature field
# Note that while temperatures are specified for the model sides, these values are
# not used as the sides are not specified "Fixed temperature boundaries".  Rather,
# these boundaries are insulating (zero net heat flux).
subsection Boundary temperature model
  set Fixed temperature boundary indicators = bottom, top
  set List of model names = box

  subsection Box
    set Bottom temperature = 1573
    set Top temperature    =  273
