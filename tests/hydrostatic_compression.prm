# A testcase with manufactured solution that demonstrates that the mass
# formulation "hydrostatic pressure" is correct and converges. The example is
# constructed to have
#
# -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = \left( \kappa \rho \textbf{g} - \alpha \nabla T \right) \cdot \textbf{u}
#
# using a specific gravity and a force vector is used to enforce the correct u
# and p (by canceling out the gravity term). This means the test will only
# work for this mass formulation.
