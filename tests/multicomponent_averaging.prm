# This test checks that the correct averaging is done by the multicomponent
# material model. In this test, two materials are chosen, with constant mass
# fractions of 0.5. At the reference temperature (273 K), materials 1 and 2
# have densities of 2000 kg/m^3 and 3000 kg/m^3,
# which equates to volume fractions of 0.6 and 0.4.
#
# The outputs for the properties at 273 K are then:
# Density: 2400 kg/m^3 (volume averaged, 0.6*2000 + 0.4*3000)
# Thermal_expansivity: 2.4e-5 (volume averaged, 0.6*2e-5 + 0.4*3e-5)
# Specific_heat: 1500 (mass averaged, 0.5*1000 + 0.5*2000)
# Viscosity: 2.4e20 (arithmetically volume averaged, 0.6*2.e20 + 0.4*3.e20)
# Thermal conductivity: 2.4 (volume averaged, 0.6*2 + 0.4*3)
#
# At temperatures other than the reference temperature, the volume
# fractions change despite the mass fractions remaining constant.
# Therefore, the outputs at different temperatures do not have the nice
# effective values seen at the reference temperature.
