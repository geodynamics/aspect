# This test is used to check if the adiabatic heating
# is calculated correctly. It is based on the test
# adiabatic_heating, but uses the simplified adiabatic
# heating model instead.
# The material is upwelling with a constant velocity
# and without conduction of heat, so that the steady state
# of the model is an adiabatic temperature profile, and
# the temperature should not change over time.

# At the top, we define the number of space dimensions we would like to
# work in:
set Dimension                              = 2

# There are several global variables that have to do with what
# time system we want to work in and what the end time is.
set Use years instead of seconds           = false
set End time                               = 2.5e13
set Pressure normalization                 = surface
set Surface pressure                       = 0
set Adiabatic surface temperature          = 1723.15   # 1450Â°C adiabat

# Then come a number of sections that deal with the setup
# of the problem to solve. The first one deals with the
# geometry of the domain within which we want to solve.
# The sections that follow all have the same basic setup
# where we select the name of a particular model (here,
# the box geometry) and then, in a further subsection,
# set the parameters that are specific to this particular
# model.

end

# The next section deals with the initial conditions for the
# temperature (there are no initial conditions for the
# velocity variable since the velocity is assumed to always
# be in a static equilibrium with the temperature field).
# There are a number of models with the 'function' model
# a generic one that allows us to enter the actual initial
# conditions in the form of a formula that can contain
# constants. We choose a linear temperature profile that
# matches the boundary conditions defined below plus
# a small perturbation:

# The following two sections describe first the

# discussed the settings used here in the introduction to
# this cookbook in the manual already.

    set Thermal conductivity     = 0.0
  end
end

# The settings above all pertain to the description of the
# continuous partial differential equations we want to solve.
# The following section deals with the discretization of
# this problem, namely the kind of mesh we want to compute
# on. We here use a globally refined mesh without
# adaptive mesh refinement.

# The final part is to specify what ASPECT should do with the
# solution once computed at the end of every time step. The
# process of evaluating the solution is called `postprocessing'
# and we choose to compute velocity and temperature statistics,
# statistics about the heat flux through the boundaries of the
# domain, and to generate graphical output files for later
# visualization. These output files are created every time
# a time step crosses time points separated by 0.01. Given
# our start time (zero) and final time (0.5) this means that
# we will obtain 50 output files.
