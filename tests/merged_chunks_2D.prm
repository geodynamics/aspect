# In 2D the radial boundary indicators are

# zero velocity, while prescribing a velocity function on the
# upper boundaries. Note that this particular example can be accomplished
# without additional boundary indicators and just prescribing a
# velocity function on the whole radial boundaries.
# Along the top and the lithospheric part of the vertical boundaries
# we prescribe a plate velocity of 1 cm/year.
# The parameters below this comment were created by the update script
# as replacement for the old 'Model settings' subsection. They can be
