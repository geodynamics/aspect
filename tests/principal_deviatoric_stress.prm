# This is a copy of simple_shear.prm that tests the 'principal stress'
# postprocessor when computing principal stresses for the deviatoric stress
# only. Due to the nature of the benchmark the principal deviatoric stress
# should be 200/-200 Pa respectively (see simple_shear.prm) for a description
# of the benchmark.
