# Then follows a section that describes the boundary conditions for the
# temperature. The model we choose is called 'box' and allows to set a constant
# temperature on each of the four sides of the box geometry. In our case, we
# choose something that is heated from below and cooled from above. 
# All other parts of the boundary are insulated (i.e., no heat flux through
# these boundaries; this is also often used to specify symmetry boundaries).

# domain, and to generate graphical output files for later

# a time step crosses time points separated by 0.01. Given
# our start time (zero) and final time (0.5) this means that
# we will obtain 50 output files.
