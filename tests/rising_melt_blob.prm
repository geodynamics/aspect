# This is a test for the new melt solver. It checks if
# melt transport works correctly in a model that has both
# regions with and without melt (so only some of the cells
# are "melt cells").

# The initial porosity is zero everywhere, except for a
# Gaussian in the center of the model (the "melt blob").
# As there is no melting or freezing, the blob should
# just rise, conserving the total porosity.
