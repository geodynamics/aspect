# This is a test that checks that the cookbook "2D_subduction_two_phase_flow" runs correctly. It also checks
# that the two .cc files required for this cookbook work correctly by outputting the composition statistics.
# The bound_fluid should be initialized with a max value of 0.021 (due to world_builder_disequilibrium_fluid.cc)
# and this value should not decrease (due to bound_fluid_source.cc) even though the porosity becomes non-zero 
# after 100 years.
