#### This tests fixed fastscape ghost nodes using the 
# continental extension cookbook to check the maximum and 
# minimum topography of the model. If something changes with 
# the ghost nodes within the FastScape model, we would expect 
# that these would be slightly different. Here, we test when 
# the bottom and top boundaries are fixed.
