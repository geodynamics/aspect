# This is a copy of the steinberger compressible test,
# where the default nonlinear solver scheme has been replaced
# by the `iterated Advection and defect correction Stokes`
# nonlinear solver scheme.
# It is intended to test the ability of the steinberger
# material model to be used with the projected density
# approximation, which requires using compositional
# fields that do not correspond to a look-up table.
