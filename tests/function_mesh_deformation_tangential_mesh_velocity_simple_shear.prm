# This test is a modified version of
# function_mesh_deformation_tangential_mesh_velocity.prm

# The simulation starts as a box of 200 km width and 50 km height.
# A parabolic shear velocity boundary condition is applied at the
# bottom boundary. The sides and top boundaries are intended to
# be free slip. Gravity is set to zero, and the temperature
# is constant throughout the domain.

# The mesh is deformed by prescribing a mesh velocity at the top
# boundary that goes from +10 km per million year on the left side
# to -10 km per million year on the right side, thus keeping the
# overall area of the domain fixed.
# The meshes at the left and right boundaries are allowed
# to deform along their length.

# Two unexpected things happen during this test.
# First, there are very different solutions
# for the first and second time step,
# after which the evolution is more smooth. Secondly, the
# velocity along the top boundary is not tangential
# to the boundary. There is outflow at the right
# side and inflow at the left side of the boundary.
