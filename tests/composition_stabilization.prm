# This is a test for the stabilization of the advection
# equation for compositional fields. The flow is 
# symmetric around the origin, and two fields that 
# each feature a circle of compositional distinct 
# material are advected with the flow. Rotating field C_2
# by 180 degrees should yield the same result as C_1.
# It is a variation of the platelike_boundary.prm file.
# All settings are exactly the same with the exception
# of the ones that pertain to compositional fields.
