# We use a boundary temperature model
# with additional boundary indicators
# as prescribed by the geometry model
# In 2D the additional boundary indicators have value 4 (left lithosphere)
# and 5 (right lithosphere). Because we want flow through these boundaries
# we set fixed temperature and composition boundary conditions.
# For now we set the lower part of the vertical boundaries to
# zero velocity, while prescribing a velocity function on boundary
# 4 and 5. Note that this particular example can be accomplished
# without additional boundary indicators and just prescribing a
# velocity function on the whole vertical boundaries.
# Along the top and the lithospheric part of the vertical boundaries
# we prescribe a plate velocity of 1 cm/year.
