# A test that deals with the problem that if there is no flow then the
# convection time step is infinite. in that case, we need to limit the
# time step size to something related to the conduction time step
#
# We make sure that there is no flow in this particular situation by using
# zero boundary conditions and a zero thermal expansion coefficient so
# that the right hand side of the velocity is constant.
