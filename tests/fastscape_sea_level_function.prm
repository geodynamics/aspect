# This test verifies the input sea level function for the Fastscape Plugin.
# Sea level can be specified either as a constant or as a time-dependent function.
# In this case, sea level decreases linearly with time during 500 kyrs.
# The results can be visualized in the Fastscape sea level VTK output file.
# Enable if: ASPECT_WITH_FASTSCAPE
