# this test is specifically designed for the bound-preserving limiter
# A description of the falling box benchmark see the reference:
# Gerya, T. V., Yuen, D. A., 2003a. Characteristics-based marker-in-cell method
# with conservative finite-differences schemes for modeling geological flows with
# strongly variable transport properties
# This test uses two falling boxes in order to use two different compositional fields
