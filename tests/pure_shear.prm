# This parameter file reproduces an analytical benchmark for the evolution
# of finite strain in a model of pure shear as described (for a specific
# application) in McKenzie & Jackson (1983): "The relationship between
# strain rates, crustal thickening, paleomagnetism, finite strain and
# fault movements within a deforming zone." They show that the analytical
# solution for the deformation gradient tensor F in pure shear deformation is:
#
# F_xx = e^(u_x,x * t)
# F_xy = 0
# F_yx = 0
# F_yy = e^(-u_x,x * t),
#
# where u is the velocity, t is time, and a comma represents a derivative
# in that particular direction. u_x,x in this example is equivalent to
# -u_y,y so that also: F_yy = e^(u_y,y * t) which is intuitive.
# For this benchmark it is important to recognize that the deformation in
# this model is actually only "pure" pure shear at the origin, since the
# deformation field around is a mixture of pure shear and a rotational
# component. Also the value of u_x,x at the origin is not prescribed
# directly, but is a model output, because we only know velocity profiles
# for the top and right boundaries. Using the computed velocity field we
# can calculate u_x,x approximately at the origin to be 1.253, and therefore
# expect:
# F_xx (t=1.0) = 3.501
# F_yy (t=1.0) = 0.2856
# This parameter file tracks the finite strain in two ways, once by using
# compositional fields as illustrated in the finite strain cookbook, and
# once by using a particle particle that sits and remains at the origin.
# The results should of course be the same.
#
# Numerical results for particle tracking show excellent agreement:
# F_xx (t=1.0) = 3.50088
# F_yy (t=1.0) = 0.285643
#
# Numerical results for compositional fields also show good results.
# F_xx (t=1.0) = 3.49776
# F_yy (t=1.0) = 0.286723
# The compositional field results are slightly less accurate, probably due to
# numerical diffusion, but were found to converge against the analytical
# values with increasing resolution.
