   WARNING: The nonlinear solver in the current timestep failed to converge.
   Acting according to the parameter 'Nonlinear solver failure strategy':
   Continuing to the next timestep even though solution is not fully converged.

   Postprocessing:
viscosity depends on
density depends on
compressibility depends on
specific_heat depends on
thermal_conductivity depends on
model is compressible

Termination requested by criterion: end time




WARNING: During this computation 1 nonlinear solver failures occurred!
