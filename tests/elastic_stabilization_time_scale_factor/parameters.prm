# Listing of Parameters
# ---------------------
# A list of names of additional shared libraries that should be loaded upon
# starting up the program. The names of these files can contain absolute or
# relative paths (relative to the directory in which you call ASPECT). In
# fact, file names that do not contain any directory information (i.e., only
# the name of a file such as <myplugin.so> will not be found if they are not
# located in one of the directories listed in the \texttt{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
# environment variable. In order to load a library in the current directory,
# use <./myplugin.so> instead.
# 
# The typical use of this parameter is so that you can implement additional
# plugins in your own directories, rather than in the ASPECT source
# directories. You can then simply compile these plugins into a shared library
# without having to re-compile all of ASPECT. See the section of the manual
# discussing writing extensions for more information on how to compile
# additional files into a shared library.

# In order to make the problem in the first time step easier to solve, we need
# a reasonable guess for the temperature and pressure. To obtain it, we use an
# adiabatic pressure and temperature field. This parameter describes what the
# `adiabatic' temperature would be at the surface of the domain (i.e. at depth
# zero). Note that this value need not coincide with the boundary condition
# posed at this point. Rather, the boundary condition may differ significantly
# from the adiabatic value, and then typically induce a thermal boundary
# layer.

# For more information, see the section in the manual that discusses the

# times the polynomial degree $p_T$ of the temperature discretization. The
# dimensionless constant $c$ is called the CFL number in this program. For
# time discretizations that have explicit components, $c$ must be less than a
# constant that depends on the details of the time discretization and that is
# no larger than one. On the other hand, for implicit discretizations such as
# the one chosen here, one can choose the time step as large as one wants (in
# particular, one can choose $c>1$) though a CFL number significantly larger

subsection Boundary composition model
  # When the composition is fixed on a given boundary as determined by the
  # list of 'Fixed composition boundary indicators', there might be parts of
  # the boundary where material flows out and one may want to prescribe the
  # composition only on those parts of the boundary where there is inflow.
  # This parameter determines if compositions are only prescribed at these
  # inflow parts of the boundary (if false) or everywhere on a given boundary,
  # independent of the flow direction (if true). By default, this parameter is
  # set to false, except in models with melt transport (see below). Note that
  # in this context, `fixed' refers to the fact that these are the boundary
  # indicators where Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied, and does not
  # imply that the boundary composition is time-independent.
  # 
  # Mathematically speaking, the compositional fields satisfy an advection
  # equation that has no diffusion. For this equation, one can only impose
  # Dirichlet boundary conditions (i.e., prescribe a fixed compositional field
  # value at the boundary) at those boundaries where material flows in. This
  # would correspond to the ``false'' setting of this parameter, which is
  # correspondingly the default. On the other hand, on a finite dimensional
  # discretization such as the one one obtains from the finite element method,
  # it is possible to also prescribe values on outflow boundaries, even though
  # this may make no physical sense. This would then correspond to the
  # ``true'' setting of this parameter.
  # 
  # A warning for models with melt transport: In models with fluid flow, some
  # compositional fields (in particular the porosity) might be transported
  # with the fluid velocity, and would need to set the constraints based on
  # the fluid velocity. However, this is currently not possible, because we
  # reuse the same matrix for all compositional fields, and therefore can not
  # use different constraints for different fields. Consequently, we set this
  # parameter to true by default in models where melt transport is enabled. Be
  # aware that if you change this default setting, you will not use the melt
  # velocity, but the solid velocity to determine on which parts of the
  # boundaries there is outflow.
  set Allow fixed composition on outflow boundaries = false for models without melt

  # A comma separated list of names denoting those boundaries on which the
  # composition is fixed and described by the boundary composition object
  # selected in its own section of this input file. All boundary indicators
  # used by the geometry but not explicitly listed here will end up with
  # no-flux (insulating) boundary conditions.
  # 
  # The names of the boundaries listed here can either be numbers (in which
  # case they correspond to the numerical boundary indicators assigned by the
  # geometry object), or they can correspond to any of the symbolic names the
  # geometry object may have provided for each part of the boundary. You may
  # want to compare this with the documentation of the geometry model you use
  # in your model.
  # 
  # This parameter only describes which boundaries have a fixed composition,

  # already provides what you want.

  # 'List of model operators'.
  # 
  # The following boundary composition models are available:
  # 
  # `ascii data': Implementation of a model in which the boundary composition
  # is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required
  # format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of
  # comments if they begin with `#', but one of these lines needs to contain
  # the number of grid points in each dimension as for example `# POINTS: 3
  # 3'. The order of the data columns has to be `x', `composition1',
  # `composition2', etc. in a 2d model and `x', `y', `composition1',
  # `composition2', etc., in a 3d model, according to the number of
  # compositional fields, which means that there has to be a single column for
  # every composition in the model. Note that the data in the input files need
  # to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend
  # first, followed by the second in order to assign the correct data to the
  # prescribed coordinates.If you use a spherical model, then the assumed grid
  # changes. `x' will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to the
  # bottom of the model, `y' by the azimuth angle and `z' by the polar angle
  # measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to be a
  # latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is
  # `r', `phi', `theta' and not `r', `theta', `phi', since this allows for
  # dimension independent expressions.
  # 
  # `box': A model in which the composition is chosen constant on the sides of
  # a box which are selected by the parameters
  # Left/Right/Top/Bottom/Front/Back composition
  # 
  # `box with lithosphere boundary indicators': A model in which the
  # composition is chosen constant on all the sides of a box. Additional
  # boundary indicators are added to the lithospheric parts of the vertical
  # boundaries. This model is to be used with the 'Two Merged Boxes' Geometry
  # Model.
  # 
  # `function': Implementation of a model in which the boundary composition is
  # given in terms of an explicit formula that is elaborated in the parameters

subsection Boundary temperature model

  # parts of the boundary (if false) or everywhere on a given boundary,
  # independent of the flow direction (if true).Note that in this context,
  # `fixed' refers to the fact that these are the boundary indicators where
  # Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied, and does not imply that the
  # boundary temperature is time-independent.
  # 
  # Mathematically speaking, the temperature satisfies an advection-diffusion
  # equation. For this type of equation, one can prescribe the temperature
  # even on outflow boundaries as long as the diffusion coefficient is
  # nonzero. This would correspond to the ``true'' setting of this parameter,
  # which is correspondingly the default. In practice, however, this would
  # only make physical sense if the diffusion coefficient is actually quite
  # large to prevent the creation of a boundary layer. In addition, if there
  # is no diffusion, one can only impose Dirichlet boundary conditions (i.e.,
  # prescribe a fixed temperature value at the boundary) at those boundaries
  # where material flows in. This would correspond to the ``false'' setting of
  # this parameter.

  # the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, `y' by the

  # pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that
  # the order of spherical coordinates is `r', `phi', `theta' and not `r',
  # `theta', `phi', since this allows for dimension independent expressions.
  # 
  # `box': A model in which the temperature is chosen constant on the sides of
  # a box which are selected by the parameters
  # Left/Right/Top/Bottom/Front/Back temperature
  # 
  # `box with lithosphere boundary indicators': A model in which the

  # boundaries. This model is to be used with the 'Two Merged Boxes' Geometry
  # Model.
  # 
  # `constant': A model in which the temperature is chosen constant on a given
  # boundary indicator.  Parameters are read from the subsection 'Constant'.
  # 
  # `dynamic core': This is a boundary temperature model working only with
  # spherical shell geometry and core statistics postprocessor. The
  # temperature at the top is constant, and the core mantle boundary
  # temperature is dynamically evolving through time by calculating the heat
  # flux into the core and solving the core energy balance. The formulation is
  # mainly following \cite{NPB+04}, and the plugin is used in Zhang et al.
  # [2016]. The energy of core cooling and freeing of the inner core is
  # included in the plugin. However, current plugin can not deal with the
  # energy balance if the core is in the `snowing core' regime (i.e., the core
  # solidifies from the top instead of bottom).
  # 
  # `function': Implementation of a model in which the boundary temperature is
  # given in terms of an explicit formula that is elaborated in the parameters
  # in section ``Boundary temperature model|Function''.

  # data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the first
  # coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second in order to
  # assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates. If you use a
  # spherical model, then the assumed grid changes. `x' will be replaced by
  # the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, `y' by the
  # azimuth angle and `z' by the polar angle measured positive from the north
  # pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that
  # the order of spherical coordinates is `r', `phi', `theta' and not `r',
  # `theta', `phi', since this allows for dimension independent expressions.

  # a box which are selected by the parameters
  # Left/Right/Top/Bottom/Front/Back temperature

  # temperature is chosen constant on all the sides of a box. Additional
  # boundary indicators are added to the lithospheric parts of the vertical
  # boundaries. This model is to be used with the 'Two Merged Boxes' Geometry
  # Model.

  # boundary indicator.  Parameters are read from the subsection 'Constant'.
  # 
  # `dynamic core': This is a boundary temperature model working only with
  # spherical shell geometry and core statistics postprocessor. The
  # temperature at the top is constant, and the core mantle boundary
  # temperature is dynamically evolving through time by calculating the heat
  # flux into the core and solving the core energy balance. The formulation is
  # mainly following \cite{NPB+04}, and the plugin is used in Zhang et al.
  # [2016]. The energy of core cooling and freeing of the inner core is
  # included in the plugin. However, current plugin can not deal with the
  # energy balance if the core is in the `snowing core' regime (i.e., the core
  # solidifies from the top instead of bottom).
  # 
  # `function': Implementation of a model in which the boundary temperature is
  # given in terms of an explicit formula that is elaborated in the parameters
  # in section ``Boundary temperature model|Function''.
  # 
  # Since the symbol $t$ indicating time may appear in the formulas for the
  # prescribed temperatures, it is interpreted as having units seconds unless
  # the global input parameter ``Use years in output instead of seconds'' is
  # set, in which case we interpret the formula expressions as having units
  # year.
  # 
  # Because this class simply takes what the function calculates, this class
  # can not know certain pieces of information such as the minimal and maximal
  # temperature on the boundary. For operations that require this, for example
  # in post-processing, this boundary temperature model must therefore be told
  # what the minimal and maximal values on the boundary are. This is done
  # using parameters set in section ``Boundary temperature model/Initial
  # temperature''.

  # The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the
  # muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

  # `ascii data': Implementation of a model in which the boundary velocity is
  # derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required
  # format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of
  # comments if they begin with `#', but one of these lines needs to contain
  # the number of grid points in each dimension as for example `# POINTS: 3
  # 3'. The order of the data columns has to be `x', `velocity${}_x$',
  # `velocity${}_y$' in a 2d model or `x', `y', `velocity${}_x$',
  # `velocity${}_y$', `velocity${}_z$' in a 3d model. Note that the data in
  # the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the first
  # coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second in order to
  # assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates.If you use a
  # spherical model, then the assumed grid changes. `x' will be replaced by
  # the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, `y' by the
  # azimuth angle and `z' by the polar angle measured positive from the north
  # pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that
  # the order of spherical coordinates is `r', `phi', `theta' and not `r',
  # `theta', `phi', since this allows for dimension independent expressions.
  # Velocities can be specified using cartesian (by default) or spherical unit
  # vectors. No matter which geometry model is chosen, the unit of the

subsection Compositional fields
  # A comma separated list denoting the solution method of each compositional
  # field. Each entry of the list must be one of the currently implemented

  # 
  # These choices correspond to the following methods by which compositional
  # fields gain their values:\begin{itemize}\item ``field'': If a
  # compositional field is marked with this method, then its values are
  # computed in each time step by advecting along the values of the previous
  # time step using the velocity field, and applying reaction rates to it. In
  # other words, this corresponds to the usual notion of a composition field
  # as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:compositional}.
  # \item ``particles'': If a compositional field is marked with this method,
  # then its values are obtained in each time step by interpolating the
  # corresponding properties from the particles located on each cell. The time
  # evolution therefore happens because particles move along with the velocity
  # field, and particle properties can react with each other as well. See
  # Section~\ref{sec:particles} for more information about how particles
  # behave.
  # \item ``volume of fluid``: If a compositional field is marked with this
  # method, then its values are obtained in each timestep by reconstructing a
  # polynomial finite element approximation on each cell from a volume of
  # fluid interface tracking method, which is used to compute the advection
  # updates.
  # \item ``static'': If a compositional field is marked this way, then it
  # does not evolve at all. Its values are simply set to the initial
  # conditions, and will then never change.
  # \item ``melt field'': If a compositional field is marked with this method,
  # then its values are computed in each time step by advecting along the
  # values of the previous time step using the melt velocity, and applying
  # reaction rates to it. In other words, this corresponds to the usual notion
  # of a composition field as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:compositional},
  # except that it is advected with the melt velocity instead of the solid
  # velocity. This method can only be chosen if melt transport is active in
  # the model.
  # \item ``prescribed field'': The value of these fields is determined in
  # each time step from the material model. If a compositional field is marked
  # with this method, then the value of a specific additional material model
  # output, called the `PrescribedFieldOutputs' is interpolated onto the
  # field. This field does not change otherwise, it is not advected with the
  # flow.
  # \item ``prescribed field with diffusion'': If a compositional field is
  # marked this way, the value of a specific additional material model output,
  # called the `PrescribedFieldOutputs' is interpolated onto the field, as in
  # the ``prescribed field'' method. Afterwards, the field is diffused based
  # on a solver parameter, the diffusion length scale, smoothing the field.
  # Specifically, the field is updated by solving the equation $(I-l^2 \Delta)
  # C_\text{smoothed} = C_\text{prescribed}$, where $l$ is the diffusion
  # length scale. Note that this means that the amount of diffusion is
  # independent of the time step size, and that the field is not advected with
  # the flow.\end{itemize}

  # and each value must be one of the currently selected particle properties.

  # parameter will yield the element $Q_2^d \times Q_1$ for the $d$ velocity
  # components and the pressure, respectively (unless the `Use locally
  # conservative discretization' parameter is set, which modifies the pressure
  # element).
  #

  # field via the interior-penalty discontinuous Galerkin method.
  set Use discontinuous temperature discretization = false

  # By default (i.e., when this parameter is set to its default value `false')
  # \aspect{} uses finite element combinations in which the pressure shape
  # functions are polynomials one degree lower than the shape functions for
  # the velocity. An example is the Taylor-Hood element that uses $Q_k$
  # elements for the velocity and $Q_{k-1}$ for the pressure. This is because
  # using the \textit{same} polynomial degree for both the velocity and the
  # pressure turns out to violate some mathematical properties necessary to
  # make the problem solvable. (In particular, thecondition in question goes
  # by the name ``inf-sup'' or Babu{\v s}ka-Brezzi or LBB condition.) A
  # consequence of violating this condition is that the pressure may show
  # oscillations and not converge to the correct pressure.
  # 
  # That said, people have often used $Q_1$ elements for both thevelocity and
  # pressure anyway. This is commonly referred to as using the Q1-Q1 method.
  # It is, by default, not stable as mentioned above, but it can be made
  # stable by adding small amount of compressibility to the model. There are
  # numerous ways to do that. Today, the way that is generally considered to
  # be the best approach is the one by Dohrmann and Bochev
  # \cite{DohrmannBochev2004}.
  # 
  # When this parameter is set to ``true'', then \aspect{} will use this
  # method by using $Q_k	imes Q_k$ elements for velocity and pressure,
  # respectively, where $k$ is the value provided for the parameter ``Stokes
  # velocity polynomial degree''.
  # 
  # \note{While \aspect{} \textit{allows} you to use this   method, it is
  # generally understood that this is not a   great idea as it leads to rather
  # low accuracy in   general. It also leads to substantial problems when
  # using free surfaces. As a consequence, the presence   of this parameter
  # should not be seen as an   endorsement of the method, or a suggestion to
  # actually use it. It simply makes the method available.}

  # 
  # When using a locally conservative discretization, the finite element space
  # for the pressure is discontinuous between cells and is the polynomial
  # space $P_{-(k-1)}$ of polynomials of degree $k-1$ in each variable
  # separately. Here, $k$ is the value given in the parameter ``Stokes
  # velocity polynomial degree'', and consequently the polynomial degree for
  # the pressure, $k-1$, is one lower than that for the velocity.
  # 
  # As a consequence of choosing this element for the pressure rather than the
  # more commonly used $Q_{k-1}$ element that is continuous, it can be shown
  # that if the medium is considered incompressible then the computed discrete
  # velocity field $\mathbf u_h$ satisfies the property $\int_ {\partial K}
  # \mathbf u_h \cdot \mathbf n = 0$ for every cell $K$, i.e., for each cell
  # inflow and outflow exactly balance each other as one would expect for an
  # incompressible medium. In other words, the velocity field is
  # \textit{locally conservative}.
  # 
  # On the other hand, if this parameter is set to ``false''(the default),
  # then the finite element space is chosen as $Q_{k-1}$. This choice does not
  # yield the local conservation property but has the advantage of requiring
  # fewer degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the error is generally smaller with
  # this choice.

  # For an in-depth discussion of these issues and a quantitative evaluation

subsection Geometry model
  # Select one of the following models:
  # 
  # `box': A box geometry parallel to the coordinate directions. The extent of
  # the box in each coordinate direction is set in the parameter file. The box
  # geometry labels its 2*dim sides as follows: in 2d, boundary indicators 0
  # through 3 denote the left, right, bottom and top boundaries; in 3d,
  # boundary indicators 0 through 5 indicate left, right, front, back, bottom
  # and top boundaries (see also the documentation of the deal.II class
  # ``GeometryInfo''). You can also use symbolic names ``left'', ``right'',
  # etc., to refer to these boundaries in input files. It is also possible to
  # add initial topography to the box model. Note however that this is done
  # after the last initial adaptive refinement cycle. Also, initial topography
  # is supposed to be small, as it is not taken into account when depth or a
  # representative point is computed.
  # 
  # `box with lithosphere boundary indicators': A box geometry parallel to the
  # coordinate directions. The extent of the box in each coordinate direction
  # is set in the parameter file. This geometry model labels its sides with
  # 2*dim+2*(dim-1) boundary indicators: in 2d, boundary indicators 0 through
  # 3 denote the left, right, bottom and top boundaries, while indicators4 and
  # 5 denote the upper part of the left and right vertical boundary,
  # respectively. In 3d, boundary indicators 0 through 5 indicate left, right,
  # front, back, bottom and top boundaries (see also the documentation of the
  # deal.II class ``GeometryInfo''), while indicators 6, 7, 8 and 9 denote the
  # left, right, front and back upper parts of the vertical boundaries,
  # respectively. You can also use symbolic names ``left'', ``right'', ``left
  # lithosphere'', etc., to refer to these boundaries in input files.
  # 
  # Note that for a given ``Global refinement level'' and no user-specified
  # ``Repetitions'', the lithosphere part of the mesh will be more refined.
  # 
  # The additional boundary indicators for the lithosphere allow for selecting
  # boundary conditions for the lithosphere different from those for the
  # underlying mantle. An example application of this geometry is to prescribe
  # a velocity on the lithospheric plates, but use open boundary conditions
  # underneath.
  # 
  # `chunk': A geometry which can be described as a chunk of a spherical
  # shell, bounded by lines of longitude, latitude and radius. The minimum and
  # maximum longitude, latitude (if in 3d) and depth of the chunk is set in
  # the parameter file. The chunk geometry labels its 2*dim sides as follows:
  # ``west'' and ``east'': minimum and maximum longitude, ``south'' and
  # ``north'': minimum and maximum latitude, ``inner'' and ``outer'': minimum
  # and maximum radii.
  # 
  # The dimensions of the model are specified by parameters of the following
  # form: Chunk (minimum || maximum) (longitude || latitude): edges of
  # geographical quadrangle (in degrees)Chunk (inner || outer) radius: Radii
  # at bottom and top of chunk(Longitude || Latitude || Radius) repetitions:
  # number of cells in each coordinate direction.
  # 
  # When used in 2d, this geometry does not imply the use of a spherical
  # coordinate system. Indeed, in 2d the geometry is simply a sector of an
  # annulus in a Cartesian coordinate system and consequently would correspond
  # to a sector of a cross section of the fluid filled space between two
  # infinite cylinders where one has made the assumption that the velocity in
  # direction of the cylinder axes is zero. This is consistent with the
  # definition of what we consider the two-dimension case given in
  # Section~\ref{sec:meaning-of-2d}. It is also possible to add initial
  # topography to the chunk geometry, based on an ascii data file.
  # 
  # `ellipsoidal chunk': A 3D chunk geometry that accounts for Earth's
  # ellipticity (default assuming the WGS84 ellipsoid definition) which can be
  # defined in non-coordinate directions. In the description of the
  # ellipsoidal chunk, two of the ellipsoidal axes have the same length so
  # that there is only a semi-major axis and a semi-minor axis. The user has
  # two options for creating an ellipsoidal chunk geometry: 1) by defining two
  # opposing points (SW and NE or NW and SE) a coordinate parallel ellipsoidal
  # chunk geometry will be created. 2) by defining three points a
  # non-coordinate parallel ellipsoidal chunk will be created. The points are
  # defined in the input file by longitude:latitude. It is also possible to
  # define additional subdivisions of the mesh in each direction. The boundary
  # of the domain is formed by linear interpolation in longitude-latitude
  # space between adjacent points (i.e. [lon, lat](f) = [lon1*f + lon2*(1-f),
  # lat1*f + lat2*(1-f)], where f is a value between 0 and 1). Faces of the
  # model are defined as 0, west; 1,east; 2, south; 3, north; 4, inner; 5,
  # outer.
  # 
  # This geometry model supports initial topography for deforming the initial
  # mesh.
  # 
  # `sphere': A geometry model for a sphere with a user specified radius. This
  # geometry has only a single boundary, so the only valid boundary indicator
  # to specify in input files is ``0''. It can also be referenced by the
  # symbolic name ``surface'' in input files.
  # 
  # Despite the name, this geometry does not imply the use of a spherical
  # coordinate system when used in 2d. Indeed, in 2d the geometry is simply a
  # circle in a Cartesian coordinate system and consequently would correspond
  # to a cross section of the fluid filled interior of an infinite cylinder
  # where one has made the assumption that the velocity in direction of the
  # cylinder axes is zero. This is consistent with the definition of what we
  # consider the two-dimension case given in Section~\ref{sec:meaning-of-2d}.
  # 
  # `spherical shell': A geometry representing a spherical shell or a piece of
  # it. Inner and outer radii are read from the parameter file in subsection
  # 'Spherical shell'.
  # 
  # The spherical shell may be generated as per the original code (with
  # respect to the inner and outer radius, and an initial number of cells
  # along circumference) or following a custom mesh scheme: list of radial
  # values or number of slices. A surface mesh is first generated and refined
  # as desired, before it is extruded radially. A list of radial values
  # subdivides the spherical shell at specified radii. The number of slices
  # subdivides the spherical shell into N slices of equal thickness. The
  # custom spherical shell only works with an opening angle of 360 degrees.
  # 
  # Despite the name, this geometry does not imply the use of a spherical
  # coordinate system when used in 2d. Indeed, in 2d the geometry is simply an
  # annulus in a Cartesian coordinate system and consequently would correspond
  # to a cross section of the fluid filled space between two infinite
  # cylinders where one has made the assumption that the velocity in direction
  # of the cylinder axes is zero. This is consistent with the definition of
  # what we consider the two-dimension case given in
  # Section~\ref{sec:meaning-of-2d}.
  # 
  # The model assigns boundary indicators as follows: In 2d, inner and outer
  # boundaries get boundary indicators zero and one, and if the opening angle
  # set in the input file is less than 360, then left and right boundaries are
  # assigned indicators two and three. These boundaries can also be referenced
  # using the symbolic names `inner', `outer' and (if applicable) `left',
  # `right'.
  # 
  # In 3d, inner and outer indicators are treated as in 2d. If the opening
  # angle is chosen as 90 degrees, i.e., the domain is the intersection of a
  # spherical shell and the first octant, then indicator 2 is at the face
  # $x=0$, 3 at $y=0$, and 4 at $z=0$. These last three boundaries can then
  # also be referred to as `east', `west' and `south' symbolically in input
  # files.

  # begin with `#', but one of these lines needs to contain the number of
  # points in the reference state as for example `# POINTS: 3'. Following the
  # comment lines there has to be a single line containing the names of all
  # data columns, separated by arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not
  # allowed to contain spaces. The file can contain unnecessary columns, but
  # for this plugin it needs to at least provide a column named `gravity'.

  # increasing depth from 0 to the maximal depth in the model domain. Points
  # in the model that are outside of the provided depth range will be assigned
  # the maximum or minimum depth values, respectively. Points do not need to
  # be equidistant, but the computation of properties is optimized in speed if
  # they are.

  # Earth Model (PREM). Use `ascii data' instead of `radial earth-like'.

  # model of adiabatic heating of melt. The full model implements the heating
  # term
  # $\alpha T (-\phi \mathbf u_s \cdot \nabla p) + \alpha T (\phi \mathbf u_f
  # \cdot \nabla p)$.
  # For full adiabatic heating, this has to be used in combination with the

  # the solid part, and the full heating term is then $\alpha T ((1-\phi)
  # \mathbf u_s \cdot \nabla p) + \alpha T (\phi \mathbf u_f \cdot \nabla p)$.

  # `compositional heating': Implementation of a model in which magnitude of
  # internal heat production is determined from fixed values assigned to each
  # compositional field. These values are interpreted as having units
  # \si{\watt\per\meter\cubed}.

  # in terms of an explicit formula that is elaborated in the parameters in
  # section ``Heating model|Function''. The format of these functions follows
  # the syntax understood by the muparser library, see
  # Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.
  # 
  # The formula is interpreted as having units W/kg.
  # 
  # Since the symbol $t$ indicating time may appear in the formulas for the
  # heating rate, it is interpreted as having units seconds unless the global
  # parameter ``Use years in output instead of seconds'' is set.
  # 
  # `latent heat': Implementation of a standard model for latent heat.
  # 
  # `latent heat melt': Implementation of a standard model for latent heat of
  # melting. This assumes that there is a compositional field called porosity,
  # and it uses the reaction term of this field (the fraction of material that
  # melted in the current time step) multiplied by a constant entropy change
  # for melting all of the material as source term of the heating model.
  # If there is no field called porosity, the heating terms are 0.
  # 
  # `radioactive decay': Implementation of a model in which the internal
  # heating rate is radioactive decaying in the following rule:
  # \[(\text{initial concentration})\cdot 0.5^{\text{time}/(\text{half
  # life})}\]
  # The crust and mantle can have different concentrations, and the crust can
  # be defined either by depth or by a certain compositional field.
  # The formula is interpreted as having units W/kg.

  # `shear heating': Implementation of a standard model for shear heating.
  # Adds the term: $  2 \eta \left( \varepsilon - \frac{1}{3} \text{tr}
  # \varepsilon \mathbf 1 \right) : \left( \varepsilon - \frac{1}{3} \text{tr}
  # \varepsilon \mathbf 1 \right)$ to the right-hand side of the temperature
  # equation.
  #

  # heating of migrating melt, including bulk (compression) heating $\xi
  # \left( \nabla \cdot \mathbf u_s \right)^2 $ and heating due to melt
  # segregation $\frac{\eta_f \phi^2}{k} \left( \mathbf u_f - \mathbf u_s

subsection Initial composition model
  # A comma-separated list of initial composition models that together

  # 
  # The following composition models are available:
  # 
  # `adiabatic density': Specify the initial composition as the adiabatic
  # reference density at each position. Note that only the field with the name
  # 'density\_field' will be filled for all other fields this plugin returns
  # 0.0.
  # 
  # `ascii data': Implementation of a model in which the initial composition
  # is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required
  # format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of
  # comments if they begin with `#', but one of these lines needs to contain
  # the number of grid points in each dimension as for example `# POINTS: 3
  # 3'. The order of the data columns has to be `x', `y', `composition1',
  # `composition2', etc. in a 2d model and `x', `y', `z', `composition1',
  # `composition2', etc. in a 3d model, according to the number of
  # compositional fields, which means that there has to be a single column for
  # every composition in the model.Note that the data in the input files need
  # to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend
  # first, followed by the second and the third at last in order to assign the
  # correct data to the prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model,
  # then the assumed grid changes. `x' will be replaced by the radial distance
  # of the point to the bottom of the model, `y' by the azimuth angle and `z'
  # by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be
  # assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical
  # coordinates is `r', `phi', `theta' and not `r', `theta', `phi', since this
  # allows for dimension independent expressions.
  # 
  # `ascii data layered': Implementation of a model in which the initial
  # composition is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Each
  # file defines a surface on which compositional fields are defined. Between
  # the surfaces, the fields can be chosen to be constant (with a value
  # defined by the nearest shallower surface), or linearly interpolated
  # between surfaces. Note the required format of the input ascii data file:
  # The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with `#',
  # but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each
  # dimension as for example `# POINTS: 3 3'. The order of the data columns
  # has to be `x', `y', `composition1', `composition2' etc. in a 2d model and
  # `x', `y', `z', `composition1', `composition2' etc. in a 3d model; i.e. the
  # columns before the lcompositional field always contains the position of
  # the surface along the vertical direction. The first column needs to ascend
  # first, followed by the second in order to assign the correct data to the
  # prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model, then the assumed
  # grid changes. `x' will be replaced by the azimuth angle and `y' (if 3D) by
  # the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The last column
  # will be the distance of the point from the origin (i.e. radial position).
  # The grid in this case will be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the
  # order of spherical coordinates in 3D is `phi', `theta', `r', `T'and not
  # `theta', `phi', `r', `T' as this is more consistent with other ASPECT
  # plugins. Outside of the region defined by the grid, the plugin will use
  # the value at the edge of the region.
  # 
  # `function': Specify the composition in terms of an explicit formula. The
  # format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser
  # library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.
  # 
  # `porosity': A class that implements initial conditions for the porosity
  # field by computing the equilibrium melt fraction for the given initial
  # condition and reference pressure profile. Note that this plugin only works
  # if there is a compositional field called `porosity', and the used material
  # model implements the 'MeltFractionModel' interface. For all compositional
  # fields except porosity this plugin returns 0.0, and they are therefore not
  # changed as long as the default `add' operator is selected for this plugin.
  # 
  # `world builder': Specify the initial composition through the World

  # Select one of the following models:
  # 
  # `adiabatic density': Specify the initial composition as the adiabatic
  # reference density at each position. Note that only the field with the name
  # 'density\_field' will be filled for all other fields this plugin returns
  # 0.0.
  # 
  # `ascii data': Implementation of a model in which the initial composition
  # is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required
  # format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of
  # comments if they begin with `#', but one of these lines needs to contain
  # the number of grid points in each dimension as for example `# POINTS: 3
  # 3'. The order of the data columns has to be `x', `y', `composition1',
  # `composition2', etc. in a 2d model and `x', `y', `z', `composition1',
  # `composition2', etc. in a 3d model, according to the number of
  # compositional fields, which means that there has to be a single column for
  # every composition in the model.Note that the data in the input files need
  # to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend
  # first, followed by the second and the third at last in order to assign the
  # correct data to the prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model,
  # then the assumed grid changes. `x' will be replaced by the radial distance
  # of the point to the bottom of the model, `y' by the azimuth angle and `z'
  # by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be
  # assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical
  # coordinates is `r', `phi', `theta' and not `r', `theta', `phi', since this
  # allows for dimension independent expressions.
  # 
  # `ascii data layered': Implementation of a model in which the initial
  # composition is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Each
  # file defines a surface on which compositional fields are defined. Between
  # the surfaces, the fields can be chosen to be constant (with a value
  # defined by the nearest shallower surface), or linearly interpolated
  # between surfaces. Note the required format of the input ascii data file:
  # The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with `#',
  # but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each
  # dimension as for example `# POINTS: 3 3'. The order of the data columns
  # has to be `x', `y', `composition1', `composition2' etc. in a 2d model and
  # `x', `y', `z', `composition1', `composition2' etc. in a 3d model; i.e. the
  # columns before the lcompositional field always contains the position of
  # the surface along the vertical direction. The first column needs to ascend
  # first, followed by the second in order to assign the correct data to the
  # prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model, then the assumed
  # grid changes. `x' will be replaced by the azimuth angle and `y' (if 3D) by
  # the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The last column
  # will be the distance of the point from the origin (i.e. radial position).
  # The grid in this case will be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the
  # order of spherical coordinates in 3D is `phi', `theta', `r', `T'and not
  # `theta', `phi', `r', `T' as this is more consistent with other ASPECT
  # plugins. Outside of the region defined by the grid, the plugin will use
  # the value at the edge of the region.
  # 
  # `function': Specify the composition in terms of an explicit formula. The
  # format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser
  # library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.
  # 
  # `porosity': A class that implements initial conditions for the porosity
  # field by computing the equilibrium melt fraction for the given initial
  # condition and reference pressure profile. Note that this plugin only works
  # if there is a compositional field called `porosity', and the used material
  # model implements the 'MeltFractionModel' interface. For all compositional
  # fields except porosity this plugin returns 0.0, and they are therefore not
  # changed as long as the default `add' operator is selected for this plugin.
  # 
  # `world builder': Specify the initial composition through the World
  # Builder. More information on the World Builder can be found at
  # \url{https://geodynamicworldbuilder.github.io}. Make sure to specify the
  # location of the World Builder file in the parameter 'World builder file'.

  subsection Function
    # A selection that determines the assumed coordinate system for the
    # function variables. Allowed values are `cartesian', `spherical', and
    # `depth'. `spherical' coordinates are interpreted as r,phi or r,phi,theta
    # in 2D/3D respectively with theta being the polar angle. `depth' will

    # that describes the function, rather than having to use its numeric value
    # everywhere the constant appears. These values can be defined using this
    # parameter, in the form `var1=value1, var2=value2, ...'.
    # 
    # A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to
    # `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual
    # formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both
    # `pi' and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)

    # addition, it may contain expressions like `if(x>0, 1, -1)' where the
    # expression evaluates to the second argument if the first argument is
    # true, and to the third argument otherwise. For a full overview of
    # possible expressions accepted see the documentation of the muparser
    # library at http://muparser.beltoforion.de/.

    # variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by
    # the values of these variables at which the function is currently
    # evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the
    # independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For

subsection Initial temperature model
  # A comma-separated list of initial temperature models that will be used to
  # initialize the temperature. These plugins are loaded in the order given,
  # and modify the existing temperature field via the operators listed in
  # 'List of model operators'.
  # 
  # The following initial temperature models are available:
  # 
  # `S40RTS perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the
  # temperature is perturbed following the S20RTS or S40RTS shear wave
  # velocity model by Ritsema and others, which can be downloaded here
  # \url{http://www.earth.lsa.umich.edu/~jritsema/research.html}. Information
  # on the vs model can be found in Ritsema, J., Deuss, A., van Heijst, H.J.
  # \& Woodhouse, J.H., 2011. S40RTS: a degree-40 shear-velocity model for the
  # mantle from new Rayleigh wave dispersion, teleseismic traveltime and
  # normal-mode splitting function measurements, Geophys. J. Int. 184,
  # 1223-1236. The scaling between the shear wave perturbation and the density
  # perturbation can be constant and set by the user with the 'Vs to density
  # scaling' parameter or depth-dependent and read in from a file. To convert
  # density the user can specify the 'Thermal expansion coefficient in initial
  # temperature scaling' parameter. The scaling is as follows: $\delta \ln
  # \rho (r,\theta,\phi) = \xi \cdot \delta \ln v_s(r,\theta, \phi)$ and
  # $\delta T(r,\theta,\phi) = - \frac{1}{\alpha} \delta \ln
  # \rho(r,\theta,\phi)$. $\xi$ is the `vs to density scaling' parameter and
  # $\alpha$ is the 'Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature
  # scaling' parameter. The temperature perturbation is added to an otherwise
  # constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile
  # (compressible model). If a depth is specified in 'Remove temperature
  # heterogeneity down to specified depth', there is no temperature
  # perturbation prescribed down to that depth.
  # Note the required file format if the vs to density scaling is read in from
  # a file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin
  # with '#', but one of these lines needs to contain the number of points in
  # the reference state as for example '# POINTS: 3'. Following the comment
  # lines there has to be a single line containing the names of all data
  # columns, separated by arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not
  # allowed to contain spaces. The file can contain unnecessary columns, but
  # for this plugin it needs to at least provide the columns named `depth' and
  # `vs\_to\_density'. Note that the data lines in the file need to be sorted
  # in order of increasing depth from 0 to the maximal depth in the model
  # domain. Points in the model that are outside of the provided depth range
  # will be assigned the maximum or minimum depth values, respectively. Points
  # do not need to be equidistant, but the computation of properties is
  # optimized in speed if they are.
  # If the plugin is used in 2D it will use an equatorial slice of the seismic
  # tomography model.
  # 
  # `SAVANI perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the
  # temperature is perturbed following the SAVANI shear wave velocity model by
  # Auer and others, which can be downloaded here
  # \url{http://n.ethz.ch/~auerl/savani.tar.bz2}. Information on the vs model
  # can be found in Auer, L., Boschi, L., Becker, T.W., Nissen-Meyer, T. \&
  # Giardini, D., 2014. Savani: A variable resolution whole-mantle model of
  # anisotropic shear velocity variations based on multiple data sets. Journal
  # of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 119.4 (2014): 3006-3034. The scaling
  # between the shear wave perturbation and the density perturbation can be
  # constant and set by the user with the 'Vs to density scaling' parameter or
  # depth-dependent and read in from a file. To convert density the user can
  # specify the 'Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling'
  # parameter. The scaling is as follows: $\delta \ln \rho (r,\theta,\phi) =
  # \xi \cdot \delta \ln v_s(r,\theta, \phi)$ and $\delta T(r,\theta,\phi) = -
  # \frac{1}{\alpha} \delta \ln \rho(r,\theta,\phi)$. $\xi$ is the `vs to
  # density scaling' parameter and $\alpha$ is the 'Thermal expansion
  # coefficient in initial temperature scaling' parameter. The temperature
  # perturbation is added to an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible
  # model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model).If a depth is
  # specified in 'Remove temperature heterogeneity down to specified depth',
  # there is no temperature perturbation prescribed down to that depth.
  # Note the required file format if the vs to density scaling is read in from
  # a file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin
  # with '#', but one of these lines needs to contain the number of points in
  # the reference state as for example '# POINTS: 3'. Following the comment
  # lines there has to be a single line containing the names of all data
  # columns, separated by arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not
  # allowed to contain spaces. The file can contain unnecessary columns, but
  # for this plugin it needs to at least provide the columns named `depth' and
  # `vs\_to\_density'. Note that the data lines in the file need to be sorted
  # in order of increasing depth from 0 to the maximal depth in the model
  # domain. Points in the model that are outside of the provided depth range
  # will be assigned the maximum or minimum depth values, respectively. Points
  # do not need to be equidistant, but the computation of properties is
  # optimized in speed if they are.
  # 
  # `adiabatic': Temperature is prescribed as an adiabatic profile with upper
  # and lower thermal boundary layers, whose ages are given as input
  # parameters.
  # 
  # `adiabatic boundary': An initial temperature condition that allows for
  # discretizing the model domain into two layers separated by a user-defined
  # isothermal boundary. The user includes an input ascii data file that is
  # formatted as 3 columns of `longitude(radians)', `colatitude(radians)', and
  # `isotherm depth(meters)', where `isotherm depth' represents the depth of
  # an initial temperature of 1673.15 K (by default). The first lines in the
  # data file may contain any number of comments if they begin with `#', but
  # one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each
  # dimension as for example `# POINTS: 69 121'. Note that the coordinates
  # need to be sorted in a specific order: the `longitude' coordinate needs to
  # ascend first, followed by the `colatitude' coordinate in order to assign
  # the correct data (isotherm depth) to the prescribed coordinates. The
  # temperature is defined from the surface (273.15 K) to the isotherm depth
  # (1673.15 K) as a linear gradient. Below the isotherm depth the temperature
  # increases approximately adiabatically (0.0005 K per meter). This plugin
  # should work for all geometry models, but is currently only tested for
  # spherical models.
  # 
  # `ascii data': Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature
  # is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required
  # format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of
  # comments if they begin with `#', but one of these lines needs to contain
  # the number of grid points in each dimension as for example `# POINTS: 3
  # 3'. The order of the data columns has to be `x', `y', `Temperature [K]' in
  # a 2d model and  `x', `y', `z', `Temperature [K]' in a 3d model, which
  # means that there has to be a single column containing the temperature.
  # Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific
  # order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second
  # and the third at last in order to assign the correct data to the
  # prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model, then the assumed
  # grid changes. `x' will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to
  # the bottom of the model, `y' by the azimuth angle and `z' by the polar
  # angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to
  # be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates
  # is `r', `phi', `theta' and not `r', `theta', `phi', since this allows for
  # dimension independent expressions.
  # 
  # `ascii data layered': Implementation of a model in which the initial
  # temperature is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Each
  # file defines a surface on which temperature is defined. Between the
  # surfaces, the temperatures can be chosen to be constant (with a value
  # defined by the nearest shallower surface), or linearly interpolated
  # between surfaces. Note the required format of the input ascii data file:
  # The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with `#',
  # but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each
  # dimension as for example `# POINTS: 3 3'. The order of the data columns
  # has to be `x', `y', `Temperature [K]' in a 2d model and `x', `y', `z',
  # `Temperature [K]' in a 3d model; i.e. the last two columns always contain
  # the position of the isotherm along the vertical direction, and the
  # temperature at that point. The first column needs to ascend first,
  # followed by the second in order to assign the correct data to the
  # prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model, then the assumed
  # grid changes. `x' will be replaced by the azimuth angle and `y' (if 3D) by
  # the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The last column
  # will be the distance of the point from the origin (i.e. radial position).
  # The grid in this case will be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the
  # order of spherical coordinates in 3D is `phi', `theta', `r', `T'and not
  # `theta', `phi', `r', `T' as this is more consistent with other ASPECT
  # plugins. Outside of the region defined by the grid, the plugin will use
  # the value at the edge of the region.
  # 
  # `ascii profile': Implementation of a model in which the initial
  # temperature is read from a file that provides these values as a function
  # of depth. Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may
  # contain any number of comments if they begin with `#', but one of these
  # lines needs to contain the number of points in the temperature profile,
  # for example `# POINTS: 10'. Following the comment lines, there has to be a
  # single line containing the names of all data columns, separated by
  # arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not allowed to contain spaces.
  # The file can contain unnecessary columns, but for this plugin it needs to
  # at least provide columns named `depth' and`temperature'.Note that the data
  # lines in the file need to be sorted in order of increasing depth from 0 to
  # the maximal depth in the model domain. Points in the model that are
  # outside of the provided depth range will be assigned the maximum or
  # minimum depth values, respectively. Points do not need to be equidistant,
  # but the computation of properties is optimized in speed if they are.
  # 
  # `continental geotherm': This is a temperature initial condition that
  # computes a continental geotherm based on the solution of the steady-state
  # conductive equation $k\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2}+\rho H = 0$ as described in e.g.
  # Turcotte and Schubert, Ch. 4.6, or Chapman (1986). As boundary conditions,
  # we take the surface temperature and the temperature of the
  # Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary (LAB).
  # The geotherm is computed for a homogeneous lithosphere composed of an
  # upper crust, lower crust and mantle layer. The crustal layers are assumed
  # to have a constant radioactive heating, and all layers are assumed to have
  # a constant thermal conductivity. Layer thicknesses, surface temperature
  # and LAB temperature should be specified by the user. For consistency, the
  # density, heat production and thermal conductivity of each layer are read
  # from the visco plastic material model and the compositional heating model.
  # 
  # For any depths below the depth of the LAB, a unrealistically high
  # temperature is returned, such that this plugin can be combined with
  # another temperature plugin through the 'minimum' operator.
  # Note that the current implementation only works for a 3-layer lithosphere,
  # even though in principle the heat conduction equation can be solved for
  # any number of layers. The naming of the compositional fields that
  # represent the layers is also very specific, namely `upper\_crust',
  # `lower\_crust', and `lithospheric\_mantle'.
  # Make sure the top and bottom temperatures of the lithosphere agree with
  # temperatures set in for example the temperature boundary conditions.
  # 
  # `function': Specify the initial temperature in terms of an explicit
  # formula. The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by
  # the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.
  # 
  # `harmonic perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the
  # temperature is perturbed following a harmonic function (spherical harmonic
  # or sine depending on geometry and dimension) in lateral and radial
  # direction from an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or
  # adiabatic reference profile (compressible model).
  # 
  # `inclusion shape perturbation': An initial temperature field in which
  # there is an inclusion in a constant-temperature box field. The size,
  # shape, gradient, position, and temperature of the inclusion are defined by
  # parameters.
  # 
  # `lithosphere mask': Implementation of a model in which the initial
  # temperature is set to a specified lithosphere temperature above the
  # lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (specified by an ascii file or maximum
  # lithosphere depth value). Below this the initial temperature is set as
  # NaN.  Note the required format of the input data file: The first lines may
  # contain any number of comments if they begin with ‘#’, but one of
  # these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension
  # as for example‘# POINTS: 3 3’. For a spherical model, the order of the
  # data columns has to be'phi', 'theta','depth (m)', where phi is the
  # azimuth angle and theta is the polar angle measured positive from the
  # north pole. This plug-in can be combined with another using the 'replace
  # if valid' operator.
  # 
  # `mandelbox': Fractal-shaped temperature field.
  # 
  # `patch on S40RTS': Implementation of a model in which the initial
  # temperature is derived from a file containing shear wave velocity
  # perturbations in ascii format (e.g. a high resolution upper mantle
  # tomography) combined with S40RTS. Note the required format of the input
  # ascii input data: The first lines may contain any number of comments if
  # they begin with '#', but one of these lines needs to contain the number of
  # grid points in each dimension as for example '# POINTS: 3 3 3'. The order
  # of the data columns has to be  `x', `y', `z', 'Vs Perturbation' in a 3d
  # model, which means that there has to be a single column containing the
  # temperature. Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a
  # specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by
  # the second and the third at last in order to assign the correct data to
  # the prescribed coordinates. In the spherical model data will be handled as
  # Cartesian, however, `x' will be replaced by the radial distance of the
  # point to the bottom of the model, `y' by the azimuth angle and `z' by the
  # polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be
  # assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical
  # coordinates is `r', `phi', `theta' and not `r', `theta', `phi', since this
  # allows for dimension independent expressions. See S40RTS documentation for
  # details on input parameters in the S40RTS perturbation subsection. The
  # boundary between the two tomography models is smoothed using a depth
  # weighted combination of Vs values within the region of smoothing.
  # 
  # `perturbed box': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is
  # perturbed slightly from an otherwise constant value equal to one. The
  # perturbation is chosen in such a way that the initial temperature is
  # constant to one along the entire boundary.
  # 
  # `polar box': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is
  # perturbed slightly from an otherwise constant value equal to one. The
  # perturbation is such that there are two poles on opposing corners of the
  # box.
  # 
  # `spherical gaussian perturbation': An initial temperature field in which
  # the temperature is perturbed by a single Gaussian added to an otherwise
  # spherically symmetric state. Additional parameters are read from the
  # parameter file in subsection 'Spherical gaussian perturbation'.
  # 
  # `spherical hexagonal perturbation': An initial temperature field in which
  # the temperature is perturbed following an $N$-fold pattern in a specified
  # direction from an otherwise spherically symmetric state. The class's name
  # comes from previous versions when the only option was $N=6$.
  # 
  # `world builder': Specify the initial temperature through the World

  # 1223-1236. The scaling between the shear wave perturbation and the density
  # perturbation can be constant and set by the user with the 'Vs to density
  # scaling' parameter or depth-dependent and read in from a file. To convert
  # density the user can specify the 'Thermal expansion coefficient in initial
  # temperature scaling' parameter. The scaling is as follows: $\delta \ln
  # \rho (r,\theta,\phi) = \xi \cdot \delta \ln v_s(r,\theta, \phi)$ and
  # $\delta T(r,\theta,\phi) = - \frac{1}{\alpha} \delta \ln
  # \rho(r,\theta,\phi)$. $\xi$ is the `vs to density scaling' parameter and
  # $\alpha$ is the 'Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature
  # scaling' parameter. The temperature perturbation is added to an otherwise
  # constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile
  # (compressible model). If a depth is specified in 'Remove temperature
  # heterogeneity down to specified depth', there is no temperature
  # perturbation prescribed down to that depth.
  # Note the required file format if the vs to density scaling is read in from
  # a file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin
  # with '#', but one of these lines needs to contain the number of points in
  # the reference state as for example '# POINTS: 3'. Following the comment
  # lines there has to be a single line containing the names of all data
  # columns, separated by arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not
  # allowed to contain spaces. The file can contain unnecessary columns, but
  # for this plugin it needs to at least provide the columns named `depth' and
  # `vs\_to\_density'. Note that the data lines in the file need to be sorted
  # in order of increasing depth from 0 to the maximal depth in the model
  # domain. Points in the model that are outside of the provided depth range
  # will be assigned the maximum or minimum depth values, respectively. Points
  # do not need to be equidistant, but the computation of properties is
  # optimized in speed if they are.
  # If the plugin is used in 2D it will use an equatorial slice of the seismic

  # 
  # `adiabatic': Temperature is prescribed as an adiabatic profile with upper
  # and lower thermal boundary layers, whose ages are given as input
  # parameters.
  # 
  # `adiabatic boundary': An initial temperature condition that allows for
  # discretizing the model domain into two layers separated by a user-defined
  # isothermal boundary. The user includes an input ascii data file that is
  # formatted as 3 columns of `longitude(radians)', `colatitude(radians)', and
  # `isotherm depth(meters)', where `isotherm depth' represents the depth of
  # an initial temperature of 1673.15 K (by default). The first lines in the
  # data file may contain any number of comments if they begin with `#', but
  # one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each
  # dimension as for example `# POINTS: 69 121'. Note that the coordinates
  # need to be sorted in a specific order: the `longitude' coordinate needs to
  # ascend first, followed by the `colatitude' coordinate in order to assign
  # the correct data (isotherm depth) to the prescribed coordinates. The
  # temperature is defined from the surface (273.15 K) to the isotherm depth
  # (1673.15 K) as a linear gradient. Below the isotherm depth the temperature
  # increases approximately adiabatically (0.0005 K per meter). This plugin
  # should work for all geometry models, but is currently only tested for
  # spherical models.
  # 
  # `ascii data': Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature
  # is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required
  # format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of
  # comments if they begin with `#', but one of these lines needs to contain
  # the number of grid points in each dimension as for example `# POINTS: 3
  # 3'. The order of the data columns has to be `x', `y', `Temperature [K]' in
  # a 2d model and  `x', `y', `z', `Temperature [K]' in a 3d model, which
  # means that there has to be a single column containing the temperature.
  # Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific
  # order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second
  # and the third at last in order to assign the correct data to the
  # prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model, then the assumed
  # grid changes. `x' will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to
  # the bottom of the model, `y' by the azimuth angle and `z' by the polar
  # angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to
  # be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates
  # is `r', `phi', `theta' and not `r', `theta', `phi', since this allows for
  # dimension independent expressions.
  # 
  # `ascii data layered': Implementation of a model in which the initial
  # temperature is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Each
  # file defines a surface on which temperature is defined. Between the
  # surfaces, the temperatures can be chosen to be constant (with a value
  # defined by the nearest shallower surface), or linearly interpolated
  # between surfaces. Note the required format of the input ascii data file:
  # The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with `#',
  # but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each
  # dimension as for example `# POINTS: 3 3'. The order of the data columns
  # has to be `x', `y', `Temperature [K]' in a 2d model and `x', `y', `z',
  # `Temperature [K]' in a 3d model; i.e. the last two columns always contain
  # the position of the isotherm along the vertical direction, and the
  # temperature at that point. The first column needs to ascend first,
  # followed by the second in order to assign the correct data to the
  # prescribed coordinates. If you use a spherical model, then the assumed
  # grid changes. `x' will be replaced by the azimuth angle and `y' (if 3D) by
  # the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The last column
  # will be the distance of the point from the origin (i.e. radial position).
  # The grid in this case will be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the
  # order of spherical coordinates in 3D is `phi', `theta', `r', `T'and not
  # `theta', `phi', `r', `T' as this is more consistent with other ASPECT
  # plugins. Outside of the region defined by the grid, the plugin will use
  # the value at the edge of the region.
  # 
  # `ascii profile': Implementation of a model in which the initial
  # temperature is read from a file that provides these values as a function
  # of depth. Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may
  # contain any number of comments if they begin with `#', but one of these
  # lines needs to contain the number of points in the temperature profile,
  # for example `# POINTS: 10'. Following the comment lines, there has to be a
  # single line containing the names of all data columns, separated by
  # arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not allowed to contain spaces.
  # The file can contain unnecessary columns, but for this plugin it needs to
  # at least provide columns named `depth' and`temperature'.Note that the data
  # lines in the file need to be sorted in order of increasing depth from 0 to
  # the maximal depth in the model domain. Points in the model that are
  # outside of the provided depth range will be assigned the maximum or
  # minimum depth values, respectively. Points do not need to be equidistant,
  # but the computation of properties is optimized in speed if they are.
  # 
  # `continental geotherm': This is a temperature initial condition that
  # computes a continental geotherm based on the solution of the steady-state
  # conductive equation $k\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2}+\rho H = 0$ as described in e.g.
  # Turcotte and Schubert, Ch. 4.6, or Chapman (1986). As boundary conditions,
  # we take the surface temperature and the temperature of the
  # Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary (LAB).
  # The geotherm is computed for a homogeneous lithosphere composed of an
  # upper crust, lower crust and mantle layer. The crustal layers are assumed
  # to have a constant radioactive heating, and all layers are assumed to have
  # a constant thermal conductivity. Layer thicknesses, surface temperature
  # and LAB temperature should be specified by the user. For consistency, the
  # density, heat production and thermal conductivity of each layer are read
  # from the visco plastic material model and the compositional heating model.
  # 
  # For any depths below the depth of the LAB, a unrealistically high
  # temperature is returned, such that this plugin can be combined with
  # another temperature plugin through the 'minimum' operator.
  # Note that the current implementation only works for a 3-layer lithosphere,
  # even though in principle the heat conduction equation can be solved for
  # any number of layers. The naming of the compositional fields that
  # represent the layers is also very specific, namely `upper\_crust',
  # `lower\_crust', and `lithospheric\_mantle'.
  # Make sure the top and bottom temperatures of the lithosphere agree with
  # temperatures set in for example the temperature boundary conditions.
  # 
  # `function': Specify the initial temperature in terms of an explicit
  # formula. The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by
  # the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.
  # 
  # `harmonic perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the
  # temperature is perturbed following a harmonic function (spherical harmonic
  # or sine depending on geometry and dimension) in lateral and radial
  # direction from an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or
  # adiabatic reference profile (compressible model).
  # 
  # `inclusion shape perturbation': An initial temperature field in which
  # there is an inclusion in a constant-temperature box field. The size,
  # shape, gradient, position, and temperature of the inclusion are defined by
  # parameters.
  # 
  # `lithosphere mask': Implementation of a model in which the initial
  # temperature is set to a specified lithosphere temperature above the
  # lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (specified by an ascii file or maximum
  # lithosphere depth value). Below this the initial temperature is set as
  # NaN.  Note the required format of the input data file: The first lines may
  # contain any number of comments if they begin with ‘#’, but one of
  # these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension
  # as for example‘# POINTS: 3 3’. For a spherical model, the order of the
  # data columns has to be'phi', 'theta','depth (m)', where phi is the
  # azimuth angle and theta is the polar angle measured positive from the
  # north pole. This plug-in can be combined with another using the 'replace
  # if valid' operator.
  # 
  # `mandelbox': Fractal-shaped temperature field.
  # 
  # `patch on S40RTS': Implementation of a model in which the initial
  # temperature is derived from a file containing shear wave velocity
  # perturbations in ascii format (e.g. a high resolution upper mantle
  # tomography) combined with S40RTS. Note the required format of the input
  # ascii input data: The first lines may contain any number of comments if
  # they begin with '#', but one of these lines needs to contain the number of
  # grid points in each dimension as for example '# POINTS: 3 3 3'. The order
  # of the data columns has to be  `x', `y', `z', 'Vs Perturbation' in a 3d
  # model, which means that there has to be a single column containing the
  # temperature. Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a
  # specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by
  # the second and the third at last in order to assign the correct data to
  # the prescribed coordinates. In the spherical model data will be handled as
  # Cartesian, however, `x' will be replaced by the radial distance of the
  # point to the bottom of the model, `y' by the azimuth angle and `z' by the
  # polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be
  # assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical
  # coordinates is `r', `phi', `theta' and not `r', `theta', `phi', since this
  # allows for dimension independent expressions. See S40RTS documentation for
  # details on input parameters in the S40RTS perturbation subsection. The
  # boundary between the two tomography models is smoothed using a depth
  # weighted combination of Vs values within the region of smoothing.
  # 
  # `perturbed box': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is
  # perturbed slightly from an otherwise constant value equal to one. The
  # perturbation is chosen in such a way that the initial temperature is
  # constant to one along the entire boundary.
  # 
  # `polar box': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is

  # 
  # `spherical hexagonal perturbation': An initial temperature field in which

  #

  #

  # viscosity|project to Q1 only viscosity
  # 
  # The process of averaging, and where it may be used, is discussed in more
  # detail in Section~\ref{sec:sinker-with-averaging}.
  # 
  # More averaging schemes are available in the averaging material model. This
  # material model is a ``compositing material model'' which can be used in
  # combination with other material models.
  set Material averaging = none

  # The name of the material model to be used in this simulation. There are
  # many material models you can choose from, as listed below. They generally
  # fall into two category: (i) models that implement a particular case of
  # material behavior, (ii) models that modify other models in some way. We
  # sometimes call the latter ``compositing models''. An example of a
  # compositing model is the ``depth dependent'' model below in that it takes
  # another, freely choosable model as its base and then modifies that model's
  # output in some way.
  # 
  # You can select one of the following models:
  # 
  # `Steinberger': This material model looks up the viscosity from the tables
  # that correspond to the paper of Steinberger and Calderwood 2006 (``Models
  # of large-scale viscous flow in the Earth's mantle with constraints from
  # mineral physics and surface observations'', Geophys. J. Int., 167,
  # 1461-1481, \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03131.x}) and
  # material data from a database generated by the thermodynamics code
  # \texttt{Perplex}, see \url{http://www.perplex.ethz.ch/}. The default
  # example data builds upon the thermodynamic database by Stixrude 2011 and
  # assumes a pyrolitic composition by Ringwood 1988 but is easily replaceable
  # by other data files.
  # 
  # `ascii reference profile': A material model that reads in a reference
  # state for density, thermal expansivity, compressibility and specific heat
  # from a text file.
  # Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may contain
  # any number of comments if they begin with `#', but one of these lines
  # needs to contain the number of points in the reference state as for
  # example `# POINTS: 3'. Following the comment lines there has to be a
  # single line containing the names of all data columns, separated by
  # arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not allowed to contain spaces.
  # The file can contain unnecessary columns, but for this plugin it needs to
  # at least provide the columns named `density', `thermal\_expansivity',
  # `specific\_heat', and `compressibility'. Note that the data lines in the
  # file need to be sorted in order of increasing depth from 0 to the maximal
  # depth in the model domain. Points in the model that are outside of the
  # provided depth range will be assigned the maximum or minimum depth values,
  # respectively. Points do not need to be equidistant, but the computation of
  # properties is optimized in speed if they are.
  # 
  # The viscosity $\eta$ is computed as \begin{equation}\eta(z,T) = \eta_r(z)
  # \eta_0 \exp\left(-A \frac{T -
  # T_{\text{adi}}}{T_{\text{adi}}}\right),\end{equation}where $\eta_r(z)$ is
  # the depth-dependence, which is a piecewise constant function computed
  # according to the list of ``Viscosity prefactors'' and ``Transition
  # depths'', $\eta_0$ is the reference viscosity specified by the parameter
  # ``Viscosity'' and $A$ describes the dependence on temperature and
  # corresponds to the parameter ``Thermal viscosity exponent''.
  # 
  # `averaging': The ``averaging'' Material model applies an averaging of the
  # quadrature points within a cell. The values to average are supplied by any
  # of the other available material models. In other words, it is a
  # ``compositing material model''. Parameters related to the average model
  # are read from a subsection ``Material model/Averaging''.
  # 
  # The user must specify a ``Base model'' from which material properties are
  # derived. Furthermore an averaging operation must be selected, where the
  # Choice should be from the list none|arithmetic average|harmonic
  # average|geometric average|pick largest|log average|NWD arithmetic
  # average|NWD harmonic average|NWD geometric average.
  # 
  # NWD stands for Normalized Weighed Distance. The models with this in front
  # of their name work with a weighed average, which means each quadrature
  # point requires an individual weight. The weight is determined by the
  # distance, where the exact relation is determined by a bell shaped curve. A
  # bell shaped curve is a continuous function which is one at its maximum and
  # exactly zero at and beyond its limit. This bell shaped curve is spanned
  # around each quadrature point to determine the weighting map for each
  # quadrature point. The used bell shape comes from Lucy (1977). The distance
  # is normalized so the largest distance becomes one. This means that if
  # variable ''Bell shape limit'' is exactly one, the farthest quadrature
  # point is just on the limit and its weight will be exactly zero. In this
  # plugin it is not implemented as larger and equal than the limit, but
  # larger than, to ensure the quadrature point at distance zero is always
  # included.
  # 
  # `compositing': The ``compositing'' Material model selects material model
  # properties from a given set of other material models, and is intended to
  # make mixing different material models easier.
  # 
  # Specifically, this material model works by allowing to specify the name of
  # another material model for each coefficient that material models are asked
  # for (such as the viscosity, density, etc.). Whenever the material model is
  # asked for the values of coefficients, it then evaluates all of the ``base
  # models'' that were listed for the various coefficients, and copies the
  # values returned by these base models into the output structure.
  # 
  # The implementation of this material model is somewhat expensive because it
  # has to evaluate all material coefficients of all underlying material
  # models. Consequently, if performance of assembly and postprocessing is
  # important, then implementing a separate material model is a better choice
  # than using this material model.
  # 
  # `composition reaction': A material model that behaves in the same way as
  # the simple material model, but includes two compositional fields and a
  # reaction between them. Above a depth given in the input file, the first
  # fields gets converted to the second field.
  # 
  # `depth dependent': The ``depth dependent'' Material model applies a
  # depth-dependent scaling to any of the other available material models. In
  # other words, it is a ``compositing material model''.
  # 
  # Parameters related to the depth dependent model are read from a subsection
  # ``Material model/Depth dependent model''. The user must specify a ``Base
  # model'' from which material properties are derived. Currently the depth
  # dependent model only allows depth dependence of viscosity - other material
  # properties are taken from the ``Base model''. Viscosity $\eta$ at depth
  # $z$ is calculated according to:\begin{equation}\eta(z,p,T,X,...) = \eta(z)
  # \eta_b(p,T,X,..)/\eta_{rb}\end{equation}where $\eta(z)$ is the
  # depth-dependence specified by the depth dependent model,
  # $\eta_b(p,T,X,...)$ is the viscosity calculated from the base model, and
  # $\eta_{rb}$ is the reference viscosity of the ``Base model''. In addition
  # to the specification of the ``Base model'', the user must specify the
  # method to be used to calculate the depth-dependent viscosity $\eta(z)$ as
  # ``Material model/Depth dependent model/Depth dependence method'', which
  # can be chosen among ``None|Function|File|List''. Each method and the
  # associated parameters are as follows:
  # 
  # ``Function'': read a user-specified parsed function from the input file in
  # a subsection ``Material model/Depth dependent model/Viscosity depth
  # function''. By default, this function is uniformly equal to 1.0e21.
  # Specifying a function that returns a value less than or equal to 0.0
  # anywhere in the model domain will produce an error.
  # 
  # ``File'': read a user-specified file containing viscosity values at
  # specified depths. The file containing depth-dependent viscosities is read
  # from a directory specified by the user as ``Material model/Depth dependent
  # model/Data directory'', from a file with name specified as ``Material
  # model/Depth dependent model/Viscosity depth file''. The format of this
  # file is ascii text and contains two columns with one header line:
  # 
  # example Viscosity depth file:\\Depth (m)    Viscosity
  # (Pa-s)\\0.0000000e+00     1.0000000e+21\\6.7000000e+05     1.0000000e+22\\
  # 
  # Viscosity is interpolated from this file using linear interpolation.
  # ``None'': no depth-dependence. Viscosity is taken directly from ``Base
  # model''
  # 
  # ``List:'': read a comma-separated list of depth values corresponding to
  # the maximum depths of layers having constant depth-dependence $\eta(z)$.
  # The layers must be specified in order of increasing depth, and the last
  # layer in the list must have a depth greater than or equal to the maximal

  # `diffusion dislocation': An implementation of a viscous rheology including
  # diffusion and dislocation creep. Compositional fields can each be assigned
  # individual activation energies, reference densities, thermal
  # expansivities, and stress exponents. The effective viscosity is defined as
  # 
  # 
  # \[\eta_{\text{eff}} = \left(\frac{1}{\eta_{\text{eff}}^\text{diff}}+
  # \frac{1}{\eta_{\text{eff}}^\text{dis}}\right)^{-1}\] where
  # \[\eta_{\text{i}} = \frac{1}{2} A^{-\frac{1}{n_i}} d^\frac{m_i}{n_i}
  # \dot{\varepsilon_i}^{\frac{1-n_i}{n_i}} \exp\left(\frac{E_i^\ast +
  # PV_i^\ast}{n_iRT}\right)\]
  # 
  # where $d$ is grain size, $i$ corresponds to diffusion or dislocation
  # creep, $\dot{\varepsilon}$ is the square root of the second invariant of
  # the strain rate tensor, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature, and
  # $P$ is pressure. $A_i$ are prefactors, $n_i$ and $m_i$ are stress and
  # grain size exponents $E_i$ are the activation energies and $V_i$ are the
  # activation volumes.
  # 
  # This form of the viscosity equation is commonly used in geodynamic
  # simulatons See, for example, Billen and Hirth (2007), G3, 8, Q08012.
  # Significantly, other studies may use slightly different forms of the
  # viscosity equation leading to variations in how specific terms are defined
  # or combined. For example, the grain size exponent should always be
  # positive in the diffusion viscosity equation used here, while other
  # studies place the grain size term in the denominator and invert the sign
  # of the grain size exponent. When examining previous work, one should
  # carefully check how the viscous prefactor and grain size terms are
  # defined.
  # 
  # The ratio of diffusion to dislocation strain rate is found by Newton's
  # method, iterating to find the stress which satisfies the above equations.
  # The value for the components of this formula and additional parameters are
  # read from the parameter file in subsection 'Material
  # model/DiffusionDislocation'.
  # 
  # `drucker prager': A material model that has constant values for all
  # coefficients but the density and viscosity. The defaults for all
  # coefficients are chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct
  # for Earth's mantle. All of the values that define this model are read from
  # a section ``Material model/Drucker Prager'' in the input file, see
  # Section~\ref{parameters:Material_20model/Drucker_20Prager}. Note that the
  # model does not take into account any dependencies of material properties
  # on compositional fields.
  # 
  # The viscosity is computed according to the Drucker Prager frictional
  # plasticity criterion (non-associative) based on a user-defined internal
  # friction angle $\phi$ and cohesion $C$. In 3D:  $\sigma_y = \frac{6 C
  # \cos(\phi)}{\sqrt(3) (3+\sin(\phi))} + \frac{2 P \sin(\phi)}{\sqrt(3)
  # (3+\sin(\phi))}$, where $P$ is the pressure. See for example Zienkiewicz,
  # O. C., Humpheson, C. and Lewis, R. W. (1975), G\'{e}otechnique 25, No. 4,
  # 671-689. With this formulation we circumscribe instead of inscribe the
  # Mohr Coulomb yield surface. In 2D the Drucker Prager yield surface is the
  # same as the Mohr Coulomb surface:  $\sigma_y = P \sin(\phi) + C
  # \cos(\phi)$. Note that in 2D for $\phi=0$, these criteria revert to the
  # von Mises criterion (no pressure dependence). See for example Thieulot, C.
  # (2011), PEPI 188, 47-68.
  # 
  # Note that we enforce the pressure to be positive to prevent negative yield
  # strengths and viscosities.
  # 
  # We then use the computed yield strength to scale back the viscosity on to
  # the yield surface using the Viscosity Rescaling Method described in
  # Kachanov, L. M. (2004), Fundamentals of the Theory of Plasticity, Dover
  # Publications, Inc. (Not Radial Return.)A similar implementation can be
  # found in GALE (https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/gale/gale-manual.pdf).
  # 
  # 
  # To avoid numerically unfavourably large (or even negative) viscosity
  # ranges, we cut off the viscosity with a user-defined minimum and maximum
  # viscosity: $\eta_eff = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\eta_min + \eta}+
  # \frac{1}{\eta_max}}$.
  # 
  # Note that this model uses the formulation that assumes an incompressible
  # medium despite the fact that the density follows the law
  # $\rho(T)=\rho_0(1-\beta(T-T_{\text{ref}}))$.
  # 
  # `dynamic friction': This model is for use with an arbitrary number of
  # compositional fields, where each field represents a rock type which can
  # have completely different properties from the others.Each rock type itself
  # has constant material properties, with the exception of viscosity which is
  # modified according to a Drucker-Prager yield criterion. Unlike the drucker
  # prager or visco plastic material models, the angle of internal friction is
  # a function of velocity. This relationship is similar to rate-and-state
  # friction constitutive relationships, which are applicable to the strength
  # of rocks during earthquakes. The formulation used here is derived from van
  # Dinther et al. 2013, JGR. Each compositional field is interpreed as a
  # volume fraction. If the sum of the fields is greater than one, they are
  # renormalized. If it is less than one, material properties for ``background
  # material'' make up the rest. When more than one field is present, the
  # material properties are averaged arithmetically. An exception is the
  # viscosity, where the averaging should make more of a difference. For this,
  # the user selectsbetween arithmetic, harmonic, geometric, or maximum
  # composition averaging.
  # 
  # `grain size': A material model that relies on compositional fields that
  # correspond to the average grain sizes of a mineral phase and source terms
  # that determine the grain size evolution in terms of the strain rate,
  # temperature, phase transitions, and the creep regime. This material model
  # only works if a compositional field named 'grain_size' is present. In the
  # diffusion creep regime, the viscosity depends on this grain size field. We
  # use the grain size evolution laws described in Behn et al., 2009.
  # Implications of grain size evolution on the seismic structure of the
  # oceanic upper mantle, Earth Planet. Sci. Letters, 282, 178–189. Other
  # material parameters are either prescribed similar to the 'simple' material
  # model, or read from data files that were generated by the Perplex or
  # Hefesto software. This material model is described in more detail in
  # Dannberg, J., Z. Eilon, U. Faul, R. Gassmoeller, P. Moulik, and R. Myhill
  # (2017), The importance of grain size to mantle dynamics and seismological
  # observations, Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst., 18, 3034–3061,
  # doi:10.1002/2017GC006944.
  # 
  # `latent heat': A material model that includes phase transitions and the
  # possibility that latent heat is released or absorbed when material crosses
  # one of the phase transitions of up to two different materials
  # (compositional fields). This model implements a standard approximation of
  # the latent heat terms following Christensen \& Yuen, 1985. The change of
  # entropy is calculated as $Delta S = \gamma \frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho^2}$ with
  # the Clapeyron slope $\gamma$ and the density change $\Delta\rho$ of the
  # phase transition being input parameters. The model employs an analytic
  # phase function in the form $X=\frac{1}{2} \left( 1 + \tanh \left(
  # \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta p_0} \right) \right)$ with $\Delta p = p -
  # p_{\text{transition}} - \gamma \left( T - T_{\text{transition}} \right)$
  # and $\Delta p_0$ being the pressure difference over the width of the phase
  # transition (specified as input parameter).
  # 
  # `latent heat melt': A material model that includes the latent heat of
  # melting for two materials: peridotite and pyroxenite. The melting model
  # for peridotite is taken from Katz et al., 2003 (A new parameterization of
  # hydrous mantle melting) and the one for pyroxenite from Sobolev et al.,
  # 2011 (Linking mantle plumes, large igneous provinces and environmental
  # catastrophes). The model assumes a constant entropy change for melting
  # 100\% of the material, which can be specified in the input file. The
  # partial derivatives of entropy with respect to temperature and pressure
  # required for calculating the latent heat consumption are then calculated
  # as product of this constant entropy change, and the respective derivative
  # of the function the describes the melt fraction. This is linearly averaged
  # with respect to the fractions of the two materials present. If no
  # compositional fields are specified in the input file, the model assumes
  # that the material is peridotite. If compositional fields are specified,
  # the model assumes that the first compositional field is the fraction of
  # pyroxenite and the rest of the material is peridotite.
  # 
  # Otherwise, this material model has a temperature- and pressure-dependent
  # density and viscosity and the density and thermal expansivity depend on
  # the melt fraction present. It is possible to extent this model to include
  # a melt fraction dependence of all the material parameters by calling the
  # function melt_fraction in the calculation of the respective parameter.
  # However, melt and solid move with the same velocity and melt extraction is
  # not taken into account (batch melting).
  # 
  # `melt global': A material model that implements a simple formulation of
  # the material parameters required for the modelling of melt transport,
  # including a source term for the porosity according to a simplified linear
  # melting model similar to \cite{schmeling2006}:
  # $\phi_{\text{equilibrium}} =
  # \frac{T-T_{\text{sol}}}{T_{\text{liq}}-T_{\text{sol}}}$
  # with $T_{\text{sol}} = T_{\text{sol,0}} + \Delta T_p \, p + \Delta T_c \,
  # C$
  # $T_{\text{liq}} = T_{\text{sol}}  + \Delta T_{\text{sol-liq}}$.
  # 
  # `melt simple': A material model that implements a simple formulation of
  # the material parameters required for the modelling of melt transport,
  # including a source term for the porosity according to the melting model
  # for dry peridotite of \cite{KSL2003}. This also includes a computation of
  # the latent heat of melting (if the `latent heat' heating model is active).
  # 
  # Most of the material properties are constant, except for the shear,
  # viscosity $\eta$, the compaction viscosity $\xi$, and the permeability
  # $k$, which depend on the porosity; and the solid and melt densities, which
  # depend on temperature and pressure:
  # $\eta(\phi,T) = \eta_0 e^{\alpha(\phi-\phi_0)} e^{-\beta(T-T_0)/T_0}$,
  # $\xi(\phi,T) = \xi_0 \frac{\phi_0}{\phi} e^{-\beta(T-T_0)/T_0}$, $k=k_0
  # \phi^n (1-\phi)^m$, $\rho=\rho_0 (1 - \alpha (T - T_{\text{adi}}))
  # e^{\kappa p}$.
  # 
  # The model is compressible only if this is specified in the input file, and
  # contains compressibility for both solid and melt.
  # 
  # `modified tait': A material model that implements the thermal modified
  # Tait equation of state as written in \cite{HP2011}. Constant values are
  # used for the thermal conductivity and viscosity. The defaults for all
  # coefficients are chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct
  # for Earth's mantle. All of the values that define this model are read from
  # a section ``Material model/Modified Tait model'' in the input file, see
  # Section~\ref{parameters:Material_20model/Modified_20Tait_20model}.
  # 
  # `multicomponent': This model is for use with an arbitrary number of
  # compositional fields, where each field represents a rock type which can
  # have completely different properties from the others. However, each rock
  # type itself has constant material properties.  The value of the
  # compositional field is interpreted as a volume fraction. If the sum of the
  # fields is greater than one, they are renormalized.  If it is less than
  # one, material properties  for ``background mantle'' make up the rest. When
  # more than one field is present, the material properties are averaged
  # arithmetically.  An exception is the viscosity, where the averaging should
  # make more of a difference.  For this, the user selects between arithmetic,
  # harmonic, geometric, or maximum composition averaging.
  # 
  # `multicomponent compressible': This model is for use with an arbitrary
  # number of compositional fields, where each field represents a rock type
  # which can have completely different properties from the others. Each rock
  # type is described by a self-consistent equation of state.  The value of
  # the  compositional field is interpreted as a volume fraction. If the sum
  # of the fields is greater than one, they are renormalized.  If it is less
  # than one, material properties  for ``background mantle'' make up the rest.
  # When more than one field is present, the bulk material properties are
  # calculated self-consistently.  An exception is the viscosity, where there
  # is no unique solution to the averaging.  For this, the user selects
  # between arithmetic, harmonic, geometric, or maximum composition averaging.
  # 
  # `nondimensional': A material model for nondimensionalized computations for
  # compressible or incompressible computations defined through Rayleigh
  # number 	ext{Ra} and Dissipation number Di. This model is made to be used
  # with the Boussinesq, ALA, or TALA formulation.
  # 
  # The viscosity is defined as \[\eta = \text{Di} / \text{Ra} \cdot \exp(-b
  # T' + c z)\] where $T'$ is the temperature variation from the adiabatic
  # temperature, $z$ is the depth, $b$ is given by ``Viscosity temperature
  # prefactor'', and $c$ by ``Viscosity depth prefactor''. If $\text{Di}$ is
  # zero, it will be replaced by 1.0 in $\eta$.
  # 
  # The density is defined as \[\rho = \exp(\text{Di}/\gamma \cdot z)  (1.0 -
  # \alpha T' + \text{Di} \gamma p'),\] where $\alpha=\text{Di}$ is the
  # thermal expansion coefficient, $\gamma$ is the Grueneisen parameter, and
  # $p'$ is the pressure variation from the adiabatic pressure. The pressure
  # dependent term is not present if ``TALA'' is enabled.
  # 
  # `perplex lookup': A material model that has constant values for viscosity
  # and thermal conductivity, and calculates other properties on-the-fly using
  # PerpleX meemum. Compositional fields correspond to the individual
  # components in the order given in the PerpleX file.
  # 
  # `replace lithosphere viscosity': The ``replace lithosphere viscosity''
  # Material model sets viscosity to a prescribed constant above the
  # lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (specified by an ascii file or maximum
  # lithosphere depth). Below the lithosphere-asthenosphereboundary the
  # viscosity is taken from any of the other available material model. In
  # other words, it is a ``compositing material model''.
  # Parameters related to the replace lithosphere viscosity model are read
  # from a subsection ``Material model/Replace lithosphere viscosity''. The
  # user must specify a ``Base model'' from which other material properties
  # are derived.
  # Note the required format of the input data file: The first lines may
  # contain any number of comments if they begin with ‘#’, but one of
  # these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension
  # as for example‘# POINTS: 3 3’. For a spherical model, the order of the
  # data columns has to be'phi', 'theta','depth (m)', where phi is the
  # azimuth angle and theta is the polar angle measured positive from the
  # north pole.
  # 
  # `simple': A material model that has constant values for all coefficients
  # but the density and viscosity. The defaults for all coefficients are
  # chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct for Earth's mantle.
  # All of the values that define this model are read from a section
  # ``Material model/Simple model'' in the input file, see
  # Section~\ref{parameters:Material_20model/Simple_20model}.
  # 
  # This model uses the following set of equations for the two coefficients
  # that are non-constant: \begin{align}  \eta(p,T,\mathfrak c) &= \tau(T)
  # \zeta(\mathfrak c) \eta_0, \\  \rho(p,T,\mathfrak c) &= \left(1-\alpha
  # (T-T_0)\right)\rho_0 + \Delta\rho \; c_0,\end{align}where $c_0$ is the
  # first component of the compositional vector $\mathfrak c$ if the model
  # uses compositional fields, or zero otherwise.
  # 
  # The temperature pre-factor for the viscosity formula above is defined as
  # \begin{align}  \tau(T) &= H\left(e^{-\beta
  # (T-T_0)/T_0}\right),\intertext{with}   \qquad\qquad H(x) &= \begin{cases}
  # \tau_{\text{min}} & \text{if}\; x<\tau_{\text{min}}, \\
  # x & \text{if}\; 10^{-2}\le x \le 10^2, \\
  # \tau_{\text{max}} & \text{if}\; x>\tau_{\text{max}}, \\
  # \end{cases}\end{align} where $x=e^{-\beta (T-T_0)/T_0}$, $\beta$
  # corresponds to the input parameter ``Thermal viscosity exponent'', and
  # $T_0$ to the parameter ``Reference temperature''. If you set $T_0=0$ in
  # the input file, the thermal pre-factor $\tau(T)=1$. The parameters
  # $\tau_{\text{min}}$ and $\tau_{\text{max}}$ set the minimum and maximum
  # values of the temperature pre-factor and are set using ``Maximum thermal
  # prefactor'' and ``Minimum thermal prefactor''. Specifying a value of 0.0
  # for the minimum or maximum values will disable pre-factor limiting.
  # 
  # The compositional pre-factor for the viscosity is defined as \begin{align}
  # \zeta(\mathfrak c) &= \xi^{c_0}\end{align} if the model has compositional
  # fields and equals one otherwise. $\xi$ corresponds to the parameter
  # ``Composition viscosity prefactor'' in the input file.
  # 
  # Finally, in the formula for the density, $\alpha$ corresponds to the
  # ``Thermal expansion coefficient'' and $\Delta\rho$ corresponds to the
  # parameter ``Density differential for compositional field 1''.
  # 
  # Note that this model uses the formulation that assumes an incompressible
  # medium despite the fact that the density follows the law
  # $\rho(T)=\rho_0(1-\alpha(T-T_{\text{ref}}))$.
  # 
  # \note{Despite its name, this material model is not exactly ``simple'', as
  # indicated by the formulas above. While it was originally intended to be
  # simple, it has over time acquired all sorts of temperature and
  # compositional dependencies that weren't initially intended. Consequently,
  # there is now a ``simpler'' material model that now fills the role the
  # current model was originally intended to fill.}
  # 
  # `simple compressible': A material model that has constant values for all
  # coefficients but the density. The defaults for all coefficients are chosen
  # to be similar to what is believed to be correct for Earth's mantle. All of
  # the values that define this model are read from a section ``Material
  # model/Simple compressible model'' in the input file, see
  # Section~\ref{parameters:Material_20model/Simple_20compressible_20model}.
  # 
  # This model uses the following equations for the density: \begin{align}
  # \rho(p,T) = \rho_0              \left(1-\alpha (T-T_a)\right)
  # \exp{\beta (P-P_0))}\end{align}This formulation for the density assumes
  # that the compressibility provided by the user is the adiabatic
  # compressibility ($\beta_S$). The thermal expansivity and isentropic
  # compressibility implied by the pressure and temperature dependence are
  # equal to the user-defined constant values only along the reference
  # isentrope, and there is also an implicit pressure dependence to the heat
  # capacity $C_p$ via Maxwell's relations.
  # 
  # `simpler': A material model that has constant values except for density,
  # which depends linearly on temperature: \begin{align}  \rho(p,T) &=
  # \left(1-\alpha (T-T_0)\right)\rho_0.\end{align}
  # 
  # \note{This material model fills the role the ``simple'' material model was
  # originally intended to fill, before the latter acquired all sorts of
  # complicated temperature and compositional dependencies.}
  # 
  # `visco plastic': An implementation of an incompressible
  # visco(elastic)-plastic rheology with options for selecting dislocation
  # creep, diffusion creep or composite viscous flow laws. Prior to yielding,
  # one may select to modify the viscosity to account for viscoelastic
  # effects. Plasticity limits viscous stresses through a Drucker Prager yield
  # criterion. Note that this material model is based heavily on the
  # DiffusionDislocation (Bob Myhill), DruckerPrager (Anne Glerum), and
  # Viscoelastic (John Naliboff) material models.
  # 
  # The viscosity for dislocation or diffusion creep is defined as \[v = \frac
  # 12 A^{-\frac{1}{n}} d^{\frac{m}{n}} \dot{\varepsilon}_{ii}^{\frac{1-n}{n}}
  # \exp\left(\frac{E + PV}{nRT}\right)\] where $A$ is the prefactor, $n$ is
  # the stress exponent, $\dot{\varepsilon}_{ii}$ is the square root of the
  # deviatoric strain rate tensor second invariant, $d$ is grain size, $m$ is
  # the grain size exponent, $E$ is activation energy, $V$ is activation
  # volume, $P$ is pressure, $R$ is the gas exponent and $T$ is temperature.
  # This form of the viscosity equation is commonly used in geodynamic
  # simulations. See, for example, Billen and Hirth (2007), G3, 8, Q08012.
  # Significantly, other studies may use slightly different forms of the
  # viscosity equation leading to variations in how specific terms are defined
  # or combined. For example, the grain size exponent should always be
  # positive in the diffusion viscosity equation used here, while other
  # studies place the grain size term in the denominator and invert the sign
  # of the grain size exponent. When examining previous work, one should
  # carefully check how the viscous prefactor and grain size terms are
  # defined.
  # 
  # One may select to use the diffusion ($v_{\text{diff}}$; $n=1$, $m!=0$),
  # dislocation ($v_{\text{disl}}$, $n>1$, $m=0$) or composite
  # $\frac{v_{\text{diff}} v_{\text{disl}}}{v_{\text{diff}}+v_{\text{disl}}}$
  # equation form.
  # 
  # The diffusion and dislocation prefactors can be weakened with a factor
  # between 0 and 1 according to the total or the viscous strain only.
  # 
  # Viscosity is limited through one of two different `yielding' mechanisms.
  # 
  # The first plasticity mechanism limits viscous stress through a Drucker
  # Prager yield criterion, where the yield stress in 3D is  $\sigma_y =
  # \frac{6C\cos(\phi) + 2P\sin(\phi)} {\sqrt(3)(3+\sin(\phi))}$ and $\sigma_y
  # = C\cos(\phi) + P\sin(\phi)$ in 2D. Above, $C$ is cohesion and $\phi$  is
  # the angle of internal friction.  Note that the 2D form is equivalent to
  # the Mohr Coulomb yield surface.  If $\phi$ is 0, the yield stress is fixed
  # and equal to the cohesion (Von Mises yield criterion). When the viscous
  # stress ($2v{\varepsilon}_{ii}$) exceeds the yield stress, the viscosity is
  # rescaled back to the yield surface:
  # $v_{y}=\sigma_{y}/(2{\varepsilon}_{ii})$. This form of plasticity is
  # commonly used in geodynamic models. See, for example, Thieulot, C. (2011),
  # PEPI 188, pp. 47-68.
  # 
  # The user has the option to linearly reduce the cohesion and internal
  # friction angle as a function of the finite strain magnitude. The finite
  # strain invariant or full strain tensor is calculated through compositional
  # fields within the material model. This implementation is identical to the
  # compositional field finite strain plugin and cookbook described in the
  # manual (author: Gassmoeller, Dannberg). If the user selects to track the
  # finite strain invariant ($e_{ii}$), a single compositional field tracks
  # the value derived from $e_{ii}^t = (e_{ii})^{(t-1)} + \dot{e}_{ii}\; dt$,
  # where $t$ and $t-1$ are the current and prior time steps, $\dot{e}_{ii}$
  # is the second invariant of the strain rate tensor and $dt$ is the time
  # step size. In the case of the full strain tensor $F$, the finite strain
  # magnitude is derived from the second invariant of the symmetric stretching
  # tensor $L$, where $L = F [F]^T$. The user must specify a single
  # compositional field for the finite strain invariant or multiple fields (4
  # in 2D, 9 in 3D) for the finite strain tensor. These field(s) must be the
  # first listed compositional fields in the parameter file. Note that one or
  # more of the finite strain tensor components must be assigned a non-zero
  # value initially. This value can be be quite small (e.g., 1.e-8), but still
  # non-zero. While the option to track and use the full finite strain tensor
  # exists, tracking the associated compositional fields is computationally
  # expensive in 3D. Similarly, the finite strain magnitudes may in fact
  # decrease if the orientation of the deformation field switches through
  # time. Consequently, the ideal solution is track the finite strain
  # invariant (single compositional) field within the material and track the
  # full finite strain tensor through particles.When only the second invariant
  # of the strain is tracked, one has the option to track the full strain or
  # only the plastic strain. In the latter case, strain is only tracked in
  # case the material is plastically yielding, i.e. the viscous stess > yield
  # stress.
  # 
  # Viscous stress may also be limited by a non-linear stress limiter that has
  # a form similar to the Peierls creep mechanism. This stress limiter assigns
  # an effective viscosity $\sigma_{\text{eff}} =
  # \frac{\tau_y}{2\varepsilon_y}
  # {\frac{\varepsilon_{ii}}{\varepsilon_y}}^{\frac{1}{n_y}-1}$ Above $\tau_y$
  # is a yield stress, $\varepsilon_y$ is the reference strain rate,
  # $\varepsilon_{ii}$ is the strain rate and $n_y$ is the stress limiter
  # exponent.  The yield stress, $\tau_y$, is defined through the Drucker
  # Prager yield criterion formulation. This method of limiting viscous stress
  # has been used in various forms within the geodynamic literature
  # \cite{chri92,vavv02,cibi13,cibi15}.When $n_y$ is 1, it essentially becomes
  # a linear viscosity model, and in the limit $n_y\rightarrow \infty$ it
  # converges to the standard viscosity rescaling method (concretely, values
  # $n_y>20$ are large enough).
  # 
  # The visco-plastic rheology described above may also be modified to include
  # viscoelastic deformation, thus producing a viscoelastic plastic
  # constitutive relationship.
  # 
  # The viscoelastic rheology behavior takes into account the elastic shear
  # strength (e.g., shear modulus), while the tensile and volumetric strength
  # (e.g., Young's and bulk modulus) are not considered. The model is
  # incompressible and allows specifying an arbitrary number of compositional
  # fields, where each field represents a different rock type or component of
  # the viscoelastic stress tensor. The stress tensor in 2D and 3D,
  # respectively, contains 3 or 6 components. The compositional fields
  # representing these components must be named and listed in a very specific
  # format, which is designed to minimize mislabeling stress tensor components
  # as distinct 'compositional rock types' (or vice versa). For 2D models, the
  # first three compositional fields must be labeled 'stress\_xx',
  # 'stress\_yy' and 'stress\_xy'. In 3D, the first six compositional fields
  # must be labeled 'stress\_xx', 'stress\_yy', 'stress\_zz', 'stress\_xy',
  # 'stress\_xz', 'stress\_yz'.
  # 
  # Combining this viscoelasticity implementation with non-linear viscous flow
  # and plasticity produces a constitutive relationship commonly referred to
  # as partial elastoviscoplastic (e.g., pEVP) in the geodynamics community.

  # However, an important distinction between this material model and the
  # studies above is the use of compositional fields, rather than tracers, to
  # track individual components of the viscoelastic stress tensor. The
  # material model will be updated when an option to track and calculate
  # viscoelastic stresses with tracers is implemented.
  # 
  # Moresi et al. (2003) begins (eqn. 23) by writing the deviatoric rate of
  # deformation ($\hat{D}$) as the sum of elastic ($\hat{D_{e}}$) and viscous
  # ($\hat{D_{v}}$) components: $\hat{D} = \hat{D_{e}} + \hat{D_{v}}$.  These
  # terms further decompose into $\hat{D_{v}} = \frac{\tau}{2\eta}$ and
  # $\hat{D_{e}} = \frac{\overset{\nabla}{\tau}}{2\mu}$, where $\tau$ is the
  # viscous deviatoric stress, $\eta$ is the shear viscosity, $\mu$ is the
  # shear modulus and $\overset{\nabla}{\tau}$ is the Jaumann corotational
  # stress rate. This later term (eqn. 24) contains the time derivative of the
  # deviatoric stress ($\dot{\tau}$) and terms that account for material spin
  # (e.g., rotation) due to advection: $\overset{\nabla}{\tau} = \dot{\tau} +
  # {\tau}W -W\tau$. Above, $W$ is the material spin tensor (eqn. 25): $W_{ij}
  # = \frac{1}{2} \left (\frac{\partial V_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} -
  # \frac{\partial V_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} \right )$.
  # 
  # If plasticity is included, the deviatoric rate of deformation may be
  # written as: $\hat{D} = \hat{D_{e}} + \hat{D_{v}} + \hat{D_{p}}$, where
  # $\hat{D_{p}}$ is the plastic component. $\hat{D_{p}}$ decomposes to
  # $\frac{\tau_{y}}{2\eta_{y}}$, where $\tau_{y}$ is the yield stress and
  # $\eta_{y}$ is the viscosity rescaled to the yield surface. The Jaumann
  # stress-rate can also be approximated using terms from the previous time
  # step ($t$) and current time step ($t + \Delta t^{e}$):
  # $\smash[t]{\overset{\nabla}{\tau}}^{t + \Delta t^{e}} \approx
  # \frac{\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e} - \tau^{t}}}{\Delta t^{e}} - W^{t}\tau^{t} +
  # \tau^{t}W^{t}$. In this material model, the size of the time step above
  # ($\Delta t^{e}$) can be specified as the numerical time step size or an
  # independent fixed time step. If the latter case is selected, the user has
  # an option to apply a stress averaging scheme to account for the
  # differences between the numerical and fixed elastic time step (eqn. 32).
  # If one selects to use a fixed elastic time step throughout the model run,
  # this can still be achieved by using CFL and maximum time step values that
  # restrict the numerical time step to a specific time.
  # 
  # The formulation above allows rewriting the total rate of deformation (eqn.
  # 29) as
  # $\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e}} = \eta_{eff} \left ( 2\hat{D}^{t + \triangle
  # t^{e}} + \frac{\tau^{t}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} + \frac{W^{t}\tau^{t} -
  # \tau^{t}W^{t}}{\mu}  \right )$.
  # 
  # The effective viscosity (eqn. 28) is a function of the viscosity ($\eta$),
  # elastic time step size ($\Delta t^{e}$) and shear relaxation time ($
  # \alpha = \frac{\eta}{\mu} $): $\eta_{eff} = \eta \frac{\Delta
  # t^{e}}{\Delta t^{e} + \alpha}$ The magnitude of the shear modulus thus
  # controls how much the effective viscosity is reduced relative to the
  # initial viscosity.
  # 
  # Elastic effects are introduced into the governing Stokes equations through
  # an elastic force term (eqn. 30) using stresses from the previous time
  # step: $F^{e,t} = -\frac{\eta_{eff}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} \tau^{t}$. This
  # force term is added onto the right-hand side force vector in the system of
  # equations.
  # 
  # When plastic yielding occurs, the effective viscosity in equation 29 and
  # 30 is the plastic viscosity (equation 36). If the current stress is below
  # the plastic yield stress, the effective viscosity is still as defined in
  # equation 28. During non-linear iterations, we define the current stress
  # prior to yielding (e.g., value compared to yield stress) as $\tau^{t +
  # \Delta t^{e}} = \eta_{eff} \left ( 2\hat{D}^{t + \triangle t^{e}} +
  # \frac{\tau^{t}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} \right ) $
  # 
  # Compositional fields can each be assigned individual values of thermal
  # diffusivity, heat capacity, density, thermal expansivity and rheological
  # parameters.
  # 
  # If more than one compositional field is present at a given point,
  # viscosities are averaged with an arithmetic, geometric harmonic (default)
  # or maximum composition scheme.
  # 
  # The value for the components of this formula and additional parameters are
  # read from the parameter file in subsection  'Material model/Visco
  # Plastic'.
  # 
  # `viscoelastic': An implementation of a simple linear viscoelastic rheology
  # that only includes the deviatoric components of elasticity. Specifically,
  # the viscoelastic rheology only takes into account the elastic shear
  # strength (e.g., shear modulus), while the tensile and volumetric strength
  # (e.g., Young's and bulk modulus) are not considered. The model is
  # incompressible and allows specifying an arbitrary number of compositional
  # fields, where each field represents a different rock type or component of
  # the viscoelastic stress tensor. The stress tensor in 2D and 3D,
  # respectively, contains 3 or 6 components. The compositional fields
  # representing these components must be named and listed in a very specific
  # format, which is designed to minimize mislabeling stress tensor components
  # as distinct 'compositional rock types' (or vice versa). For 2D models, the
  # first three compositional fields must be labeled 'stress\_xx',
  # 'stress\_yy' and 'stress\_xy'. In 3D, the first six compositional fields
  # must be labeled 'stress\_xx', 'stress\_yy', 'stress\_zz', 'stress\_xy',
  # 'stress\_xz', 'stress\_yz'.
  # 
  # Expanding the model to include non-linear viscous flow (e.g.,
  # diffusion/dislocation creep) and plasticity would produce a constitutive
  # relationship commonly referred to as partial elastoviscoplastic (e.g.,
  # pEVP) in the geodynamics community. While extensively discussed and
  # applied within the geodynamics literature, notable references include:

  # of the mesh will then be normalized to a range between zero and one and
  # the results of different criteria will then be merged through the
  # operation selected in this section.
  # 
  # The following criteria are available:
  # 
  # `artificial viscosity': A mesh refinement criterion that computes
  # refinement indicators from the artificial viscosity of the temperature or
  # compositional fields based on user specified weights.
  # 
  # `boundary': A class that implements a mesh refinement criterion which
  # always flags all cells on specified boundaries for refinement. This is
  # useful to provide high accuracy for processes at or close to the edge of
  # the model domain.
  # 
  # To use this refinement criterion, you may want to combine it with other
  # refinement criteria, setting the 'Normalize individual refinement
  # criteria' flag and using the `max' setting for 'Refinement criteria merge
  # operation'.
  # 
  # `compaction length': A mesh refinement criterion for models with melt
  # transport that computes refinement indicators based on the compaction
  # length, defined as $\delta = \sqrt{\frac{(\xi + 4 \eta/3) k}{\eta_f}}$.
  # $\xi$ is the bulk viscosity, $\eta$ is the shear viscosity, $k$ is the
  # permeability and $\eta_f$ is the melt viscosity. If the cell width or
  # height exceeds a multiple (which is specified as an input parameter) of
  # this compaction length, the cell is marked for refinement.
  # 
  # `composition': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement
  # indicators from the compositional fields. If there is more than one
  # compositional field, then it simply takes the sum of the indicators
  # computed from each of the compositional field.
  # 
  # The way these indicators are computed is by evaluating the `Kelly error
  # indicator' on each compositional field. This error indicator takes the
  # finite element approximation of the compositional field and uses it to
  # compute an approximation of the second derivatives of the composition for
  # each cell. This approximation is then multiplied by an appropriate power
  # of the cell's diameter to yield an indicator for how large the error is
  # likely going to be on this cell. This construction rests on the
  # observation that for many partial differential equations, the error on
  # each cell is proportional to some power of the cell's diameter times the
  # second derivatives of the solution on that cell.
  # 
  # For complex equations such as those we solve here, this observation may
  # not be strictly true in the mathematical sense, but it often yields meshes
  # that are surprisingly good.
  # 
  # `composition approximate gradient': A mesh refinement criterion that
  # computes refinement indicators from the gradients of compositional fields.
  # If there is more than one compositional field, then it simply takes the
  # sum of the indicators times a user-specified weight for each field.
  # 
  # In contrast to the `composition gradient' refinement criterion, the
  # current criterion does not compute the gradient at quadrature points on
  # each cell, but by a finite difference approximation between the centers of
  # cells. Consequently, it also works if the compositional fields are
  # computed using discontinuous finite elements.
  # 
  # `composition gradient': A mesh refinement criterion that computes
  # refinement indicators from the gradients of compositional fields. If there
  # is more than one compositional field, then it simply takes the sum of the
  # indicators times a user-specified weight for each field.
  # 
  # This refinement criterion computes the gradient of the compositional field
  # at quadrature points on each cell, and then averages them in some way to
  # obtain a refinement indicator for each cell. This will give a reasonable
  # approximation of the true gradient of the compositional field if you are
  # using a continuous finite element.
  # 
  # On the other hand, for discontinuous finite elements (see the `Use
  # discontinuous composition discretization' parameter in the
  # `Discretization' section), the gradient at quadrature points does not
  # include the contribution of jumps in the compositional field between
  # cells, and consequently will not be an accurate approximation of the true
  # gradient. As an extreme example, consider the case of using piecewise
  # constant finite elements for compositional fields; in that case, the
  # gradient of the solution at quadrature points inside each cell will always
  # be exactly zero, even if the finite element solution is different from
  # each cell to the next. Consequently, the current refinement criterion will
  # likely not be useful in this situation. That said, the `composition
  # approximate gradient' refinement criterion exists for exactly this
  # purpose.
  # 
  # `composition threshold': A mesh refinement criterion that computes
  # refinement indicators from the compositional fields. If any field exceeds
  # the threshold given in the input file, the cell is marked for refinement.
  # 
  # `density': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators
  # from a field that describes the spatial variability of the density,
  # $\rho$. Because this quantity may not be a continuous function ($\rho$ and
  # $C_p$ may be discontinuous functions along discontinuities in the medium,
  # for example due to phase changes), we approximate the gradient of this
  # quantity to refine the mesh. The error indicator defined here takes the
  # magnitude of the approximate gradient and scales it by $h_K^{1+d/2}$ where
  # $h_K$ is the diameter of each cell and $d$ is the dimension. This scaling
  # ensures that the error indicators converge to zero as $h_K\rightarrow 0$
  # even if the energy density is discontinuous, since the gradient of a
  # discontinuous function grows like $1/h_K$.
  # 
  # `maximum refinement function': A mesh refinement criterion that ensures a
  # maximum refinement level described by an explicit formula with the depth
  # or position as argument. Which coordinate representation is used is
  # determined by an input parameter. Whatever the coordinate system chosen,
  # the function you provide in the input file will by default depend on
  # variables `x', `y' and `z' (if in 3d). However, the meaning of these
  # symbols depends on the coordinate system. In the Cartesian coordinate
  # system, they simply refer to their natural meaning. If you have selected
  # `depth' for the coordinate system, then `x' refers to the depth variable
  # and `y' and `z' will simply always be zero. If you have selected a
  # spherical coordinate system, then `x' will refer to the radial distance of
  # the point to the origin, `y' to the azimuth angle and `z' to the polar
  # angle measured positive from the north pole. Note that the order of
  # spherical coordinates is r,phi,theta and not r,theta,phi, since this
  # allows for dimension independent expressions. Each coordinate system also
  # includes a final `t' variable which represents the model time, evaluated
  # in years if the 'Use years in output instead of seconds' parameter is set,
  # otherwise evaluated in seconds. After evaluating the function, its values
  # are rounded to the nearest integer.
  # 
  # The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the
  # muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.
  # 
  # `minimum refinement function': A mesh refinement criterion that ensures a
  # minimum refinement level described by an explicit formula with the depth
  # or position as argument. Which coordinate representation is used is
  # determined by an input parameter. Whatever the coordinate system chosen,
  # the function you provide in the input file will by default depend on
  # variables `x', `y' and `z' (if in 3d). However, the meaning of these
  # symbols depends on the coordinate system. In the Cartesian coordinate

  # 
  # `nonadiabatic temperature': A mesh refinement criterion that computes
  # refinement indicators from the excess temperature(difference between
  # temperature and adiabatic temperature.
  # 
  # `particle density': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement
  # indicators based on the density of particles. In practice this plugin
  # equilibrates the number of particles per cell, leading to fine cells in
  # high particle density regions and coarse cells in low particle density
  # regions. This plugin is mostly useful for models with inhomogeneous
  # particle density, e.g. when tracking an initial interface with a high
  # particle density, or when the spatial particle density denotes the region
  # of interest. Additionally, this plugin tends to balance the computational
  # load between processes in parallel computations, because the particle and
  # mesh density is more aligned.
  # 
  # `slope': A class that implements a mesh refinement criterion intended for
  # use with deforming mesh boundaries, like the free surface. It calculates a
  # local slope based on the angle between the surface normal and the local
  # gravity vector. Cells with larger angles are marked for refinement.
  # 
  # To use this refinement criterion, you may want to combine it with other
  # refinement criteria, setting the 'Normalize individual refinement
  # criteria' flag and using the `max' setting for 'Refinement criteria merge
  # operation'.
  # 
  # `strain rate': A mesh refinement criterion that computes the refinement
  # indicators equal to the strain rate norm computed at the center of the
  # elements.
  # 
  # `temperature': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement
  # indicators from the temperature field.
  # 
  # The way these indicators are computed is by evaluating the `Kelly error
  # indicator' on the temperature field. This error indicator takes the finite
  # element approximation of the temperature field and uses it to compute an
  # approximation of the second derivatives of the temperature for each cell.
  # This approximation is then multiplied by an appropriate power of the
  # cell's diameter to yield an indicator for how large the error is likely
  # going to be on this cell. This construction rests on the observation that
  # for many partial differential equations, the error on each cell is
  # proportional to some power of the cell's diameter times the second
  # derivatives of the solution on that cell.
  # 
  # For complex equations such as those we solve here, this observation may
  # not be strictly true in the mathematical sense, but it often yields meshes
  # that are surprisingly good.
  # 
  # `thermal energy density': A mesh refinement criterion that computes
  # refinement indicators from a field that describes the spatial variability
  # of the thermal energy density, $\rho C_p T$. Because this quantity may not
  # be a continuous function ($\rho$ and $C_p$ may be discontinuous functions
  # along discontinuities in the medium, for example due to phase changes), we
  # approximate the gradient of this quantity to refine the mesh. The error
  # indicator defined here takes the magnitude of the approximate gradient and
  # scales it by $h_K^{1.5}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of each cell. This
  # scaling ensures that the error indicators converge to zero as
  # $h_K\rightarrow 0$ even if the energy density is discontinuous, since the
  # gradient of a discontinuous function grows like $1/h_K$.
  # 
  # `topography': A class that implements a mesh refinement criterion, which
  # always flags all cells in the uppermost layer for refinement. This is
  # useful to provide high accuracy for processes at or close to the surface.
  # 
  # To use this refinement criterion, you may want to combine it with other
  # refinement criteria, setting the 'Normalize individual refinement
  # criteria' flag and using the `max' setting for 'Refinement criteria merge
  # operation'.
  # 
  # `velocity': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement
  # indicators from the velocity field.
  # 
  # The way these indicators are computed is by evaluating the `Kelly error
  # indicator' on the velocity field. This error indicator takes the finite
  # element approximation of the velocity field and uses it to compute an
  # approximation of the second derivatives of the velocity for each cell.
  # This approximation is then multiplied by an appropriate power of the
  # cell's diameter to yield an indicator for how large the error is likely
  # going to be on this cell. This construction rests on the observation that
  # for many partial differential equations, the error on each cell is
  # proportional to some power of the cell's diameter times the second
  # derivatives of the solution on that cell.
  # 
  # For complex equations such as those we solve here, this observation may
  # not be strictly true in the mathematical sense, but it often yields meshes
  # that are surprisingly good.
  # 
  # `viscosity': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement
  # indicators from a field that describes the spatial variability of the
  # logarithm of the viscosity, $\log\eta$. (We choose the logarithm of the
  # viscosity because it can vary by orders of magnitude.)Because this
  # quantity may not be a continuous function ($\eta$ may be a discontinuous
  # function along discontinuities in the medium, for example due to phase
  # changes), we approximate the gradient of this quantity to refine the mesh.
  # The error indicator defined here takes the magnitude of the approximate
  # gradient and scales it by $h_K^{1+d/2}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of
  # each cell and $d$ is the dimension. This scaling ensures that the error
  # indicators converge to zero as $h_K\rightarrow 0$ even if the energy
  # density is discontinuous, since the gradient of a discontinuous function
  # grows like $1/h_K$.
  # 
  # `volume of fluid interface': A class that implements a mesh refinement
  # criterion, which ensures a minimum level of refinement near the volume of
  # fluid interface boundary.

subsection Postprocess
  # A comma separated list of postprocessor objects that should be run at the

  # parameters which may, for example, include that they will actually do
  # something only every so many time steps or years. Alternatively, the text
  # `all' indicates that all available postprocessors should be run after each
  # time step.
  # 
  # The following postprocessors are available:
  # 
  # `Stokes residual': A postprocessor that outputs the Stokes residuals
  # during the iterative solver algorithm into a file stokes_residuals.txt in
  # the output directory.
  # 
  # `basic statistics': A postprocessor that outputs some simplified
  # statistics like the Rayleigh number and other quantities that only make
  # sense in certain model setups. The output is written after completing
  # initial adaptive refinement steps. The postprocessor assumes a point at
  # the surface at the adiabatic surface temperature and pressure is a
  # reasonable reference condition for computing these properties.
  # Furthermore, the Rayleigh number is computed using the model depth (i.e.
  # not the radius of the Earth), as we need a definition that is geometry
  # independent. Take care when comparing these values to published studies
  # and make sure they use the same definitions.
  # 
  # `boundary densities': A postprocessor that computes the laterally averaged
  # density at the top and bottom of the domain.
  # 
  # `boundary pressures': A postprocessor that computes the laterally averaged
  # pressure at the top and bottom of the domain.
  # 
  # `command': A postprocessor that executes a command line process.
  # 
  # `composition statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics
  # about the compositional fields, if present in this simulation. In
  # particular, it computes maximal and minimal values of each field, as well
  # as the total mass contained in this field as defined by the integral
  # $m_i(t) = \int_\Omega c_i(\mathbf x,t) \; \text{d}x$.
  # 
  # `core statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the
  # core evolution. (Working only with dynamic core boundary temperature
  # plugin)
  # 
  # `depth average': A postprocessor that computes depth averaged quantities
  # and writes them into a file <depth_average.ext> in the output directory,
  # where the extension of the file is determined by the output format you
  # select. In addition to the output format, a number of other parameters
  # also influence this postprocessor, and they can be set in the section
  # \texttt{Postprocess/Depth average} in the input file.
  # 
  # In the output files, the $x$-value of each data point corresponds to the
  # depth, whereas the $y$-value corresponds to the simulation time. The time
  # is provided in seconds or, if the global ``Use years in output instead of
  # seconds'' parameter is set, in years.
  # 
  # `dynamic topography': A postprocessor that computes a measure of dynamic
  # topography based on the stress at the surface and bottom. The data is
  # written into text files named `dynamic\_topography.NNNNN' in the output
  # directory, where NNNNN is the number of the time step.
  # 
  # The exact approach works as follows: At the centers of all cells that sit
  # along the top surface, we evaluate the stress and evaluate the component
  # of it in the direction in which gravity acts. In other words, we compute
  # $\sigma_{rr}={\hat g}^T(2 \eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u)- \frac 13
  # (\textrm{div}\;\mathbf u)I)\hat g - p_d$ where $\hat g = \mathbf
  # g/\|\mathbf g\|$ is the direction of the gravity vector $\mathbf g$ and
  # $p_d=p-p_a$ is the dynamic pressure computed by subtracting the adiabatic
  # pressure $p_a$ from the total pressure $p$ computed as part of the Stokes
  # solve. From this, the dynamic topography is computed using the formula
  # $h=\frac{\sigma_{rr}}{(\mathbf g \cdot \mathbf n)  \rho}$ where $\rho$ is
  # the density at the cell center. For the bottom surface we chose the
  # convection that positive values are up (out) and negative values are in
  # (down), analogous to the deformation of the upper surface. Note that this
  # implementation takes the direction of gravity into account, which means
  # that reversing the flow in backward advection calculations will not
  # reverse the instantaneous topography because the reverse flow will be
  # divided by the reverse surface gravity.
  # The file format then consists of lines with Euclidean coordinates followed
  # by the corresponding topography value.
  # 
  # (As a side note, the postprocessor chooses the cell center instead of the
  # center of the cell face at the surface, where we really are interested in
  # the quantity, since this often gives better accuracy. The results should
  # in essence be the same, though.)
  # 
  # `entropy viscosity statistics': A postprocessor that computes the maximum
  # and volume averagedentropy viscosity stabilization for the temperature
  # field.
  # 
  # `geoid': A postprocessor that computes a representation of the geoid based
  # on the density structure in the mantle, as well as the dynamic topography
  # at the surface and core mantle boundary (CMB). The geoid is computed from
  # a spherical harmonic expansion, so the geometry of the domain must be a 3D
  # spherical shell.
  # 
  # `global statistics': A postprocessor that outputs all the global
  # statistics information, e.g. the time of the simulation, the timestep
  # number, number of degrees of freedom and solver iterations for each
  # timestep. The postprocessor can output different formats, the first
  # printing one line in the statistics file per nonlinear solver iteration
  # (if a nonlinear solver scheme is selected). The second prints one line per
  # timestep, summing the information about all nonlinear iterations in this
  # line. Note that this postprocessor is always active independent on whether
  # or not it is selected in the parameter file.
  # 
  # `gravity calculation': A postprocessor that computes gravity, gravity
  # anomalies, gravity potential and gravity gradients for a set of points
  # (e.g. satellites) in or above the model surface for either a user-defined
  # range of latitudes, longitudes and radius or a list of point
  # coordinates.Spherical coordinates in the output file are radius,
  # colatitude and colongitude. Gravity is here based on the density
  # distribution from the material model (and non adiabatic). This means that
  # the density may come directly from an ascii file. This postprocessor also
  # computes theoretical gravity and its derivatives, which corresponds to the
  # analytical solution of gravity in the same geometry but filled with a
  # reference density. The reference density is also used to determine density
  # anomalies for computing gravity anomalies. Thus one must carefully
  # evaluate the meaning of the gravity anomaly output, because the solution
  # may not reflect the actual gravity anomaly (due to differences in the
  # assumed reference density). On way to guarantee correct gravity anomalies
  # is to subtract gravity of a certain point from the average gravity on the
  # map. Another way is to directly use density anomalies for this
  # postprocessor.The average- minimum- and maximum gravity acceleration and
  # potential are written into the statistics file.
  # 
  # `heat flux densities': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about
  # the heat flux density for each boundary id. The heat flux density across
  # each boundary is computed in outward direction, i.e., from the domain to
  # the outside. The heat flux is computed as sum of advective heat flux and
  # conductive heat flux through Neumann boundaries, both computed as integral
  # over the boundary area, and conductive heat flux through Dirichlet
  # boundaries, which is computed using the consistent boundary flux method as
  # described in ``Gresho, Lee, Sani, Maslanik, Eaton (1987). The consistent
  # Galerkin FEM for computing derived boundary quantities in thermal and or
  # fluids problems. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids,
  # 7(4), 371-394.''
  # 
  # Note that the ``heat flux statistics'' postprocessor computes the same
  # quantity as the one here, but not divided by the area of the surface. In
  # other words, it computes the \textit{total} heat flux through each

  # between the mimimal and maximal load should be as small as possible.
  # 
  # `mass flux statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics
  # about the mass flux across boundaries. For each boundary indicator (see
  # your geometry description for which boundary indicators are used), the

  # outside, using the formula $\int_{\Gamma_i} \rho \mathbf v \cdot \mathbf

  # `material statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about

  # = \frac{1}{|\Omega|} \int_\Omega \rho(\mathbf x) \, \text{d}x$,
  # $\left<\eta\right> = \frac{1}{|\Omega|} \int_\Omega \eta(\mathbf x) \,
  # \text{d}x$, $M = \int_\Omega \rho(\mathbf x) \, \text{d}x$, where

  # 
  # `matrix statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about
  # the matrices. In particular, it outputs total memory consumption, total
  # non-zero elements, and non-zero elements per block, for system matrix and
  # system preconditioner matrix.

  # `melt statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the
  # melt (volume) fraction. If the material model does not implement a melt
  # fraction function, the output is set to zero.
  # 
  # `memory statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about
  # the memory consumption. In particular, it computes the memory usage of the
  # system matrix, triangulation, p4est, DoFHandler, current constraints,
  # solution vector, and peak virtual memory usage, all in MB. It also outputs
  # the memory usage of the system matrix to the screen.
  # 
  # `particle count statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics
  # about the particle distribution, if present in this simulation. In
  # particular, it computes minimal, average and maximal values of particles
  # per cell in the global domain.
  # 
  # `particles': A Postprocessor that creates particles that follow the
  # velocity field of the simulation. The particles can be generated and
  # propagated in various ways and they can carry a number of constant or
  # time-varying properties. The postprocessor can write output positions and
  # properties of all particles at chosen intervals, although this is not
  # mandatory. It also allows other parts of the code to query the particles
  # for information.
  # 
  # `point values': A postprocessor that evaluates the solution (i.e.,
  # velocity, pressure, temperature, and compositional fields along with other
  # fields that are treated as primary variables) at the end of every time
  # step or after a user-specified time interval at a given set of points and
  # then writes this data into the file <point\_values.txt> in the output
  # directory. The points at which the solution should be evaluated are
  # specified in the section \texttt{Postprocess/Point values} in the input
  # file.
  # 
  # In the output file, data is organized as (i) time, (ii) the 2 or 3
  # coordinates of the evaluation points, and (iii) followed by the values of
  # the solution vector at this point. The time is provided in seconds or, if
  # the global ``Use years in output instead of seconds'' parameter is set, in
  # years. In the latter case, the velocity is also converted to meters/year,
  # instead of meters/second.
  # 
  # \note{Evaluating the solution of a finite element field at arbitrarily
  # chosen points is an expensive process. Using this postprocessor will only
  # be efficient if the number of evaluation points or output times is
  # relatively small. If you need a very large number of evaluation points,
  # you should consider extracting this information from the visualization
  # program you use to display the output of the `visualization'
  # postprocessor.}

  # `pressure statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about
  # the pressure field.
  # 
  # `rotation statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about
  # the rotational velocity of the model (i.e. integrated net rotation and
  # angular momentum). In 2D we assume the model to be a cross-section through
  # an infinite domain in z direction, with a zero z-velocity. Thus, the
  # z-axis is the only possible rotation axis and both moment of inertia and
  # angular momentum are scalar instead of tensor quantities.

  # `spherical velocity statistics': A postprocessor that computes radial,
  # tangential and total RMS velocity.
  # 
  # `temperature statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics
  # about the temperature field.
  # 
  # `topography': A postprocessor intended for use with a deforming top
  # surface.  After every step it loops over all the vertices on the top
  # surface and determines the maximum and minimum topography relative to a
  # reference datum (initial box height for a box geometry model or initial
  # radius for a sphere/spherical shell geometry model). If 'Topography.Output
  # to file' is set to true, also outputs topography into text files named
  # `topography.NNNNN' in the output directory, where NNNNN is the number of
  # the time step.

    # x}_{k,h}(T) \|  \le  C(T) \Delta t^p$$ where $\Delta t$ is the time step
    # and $p$ the convergence order of the method, and $C(T)$ is a (generally
    # unknown) constant that depends on the end time $T$ at which one compares
    # the solutions. On the other hand, an analytically computed trajectory
    # would likely use the \textit{exact} velocity, and one may be tempted to
    # compute $\| \mathbf x_k(T) - \tilde{\mathbf x}_{k,h}(T) \|$, but this
    # quantity will, in the best case, only satisfy an estimate of the form $$

    # t^p  + C_2(T) \| \mathbf u-\mathbf u_h \|  + C_3(T) \| \mathbf
    # u_h-\tilde{\mathbf u}_h \|$$ with appropriately chosen norms for the
    # second and third term. These second and third terms typically converge
    # to zero at relatively low rates (compared to the order $p$ of the

    # `composition': Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property
    # is defined by the compositional fields in the model. This can be used to
    # track solid compositionevolution over time.
    # 
    # `function': Implementation of a model in which the particle property is
    # set by evaluating an explicit function at the initial position of each
    # particle. The function is defined in the parameters in section
    # ``Particles|Function''. The format of these functions follows the syntax
    # understood by the muparser library, see
    # Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.
    # 
    # `initial composition': Implementation of a plugin in which the particle
    # property is given as the initial composition at the particle's initial
    # position. The particle gets as many properties as there are
    # compositional fields.
    # 
    # `initial position': Implementation of a plugin in which the particle
    # property is given as the initial position of the particle. This property
    # is vector-valued with as many components as there are space dimensions.
    # In practice, it is often most useful to only visualize one of the
    # components of this vector, or the magnitude of the vector. For example,
    # in a spherical mantle simulation, the magnitude of this property equals
    # the starting radius of a particle, and is thereby indicative of which
    # part of the mantle a particle comes from.
    # 
    # `integrated strain': A plugin in which the particle property tensor is
    # defined as the deformation gradient tensor $\mathbf F$ this particle has
    # experienced. $\mathbf F$ can be polar-decomposed into the left
    # stretching tensor $\mathbf L$ (the finite strain we are interested in),
    # and the rotation tensor $\mathbf Q$. See the corresponding cookbook in
    # the manual for more detailed information.
    # 
    # `integrated strain invariant': A plugin in which the particle property
    # is defined as the finite strain invariant ($\varepsilon_{ii}$). This
    # property is calculated with the timestep ($dt$) and the second invariant
    # of the deviatoric strain rate tensor ($\dot{\varepsilon}_{ii}$), where

    # property is defined as presence of melt above a threshold, which can be
    # set as an input parameter. This property is set to 0 if melt is not
    # present and set to 1 if melt is present.
    # 
    # `pT path': Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is
    # defined as the current pressure and temperature at this position. This
    # can be used to generate pressure-temperature paths of material points
    # over time.

    # `position': Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is
    # defined as the current position.
    # 
    # `velocity': Implementation of a plugin in which the particle property is
    # defined as the recent velocity at this position.

    # strain invariant a particle has experienced and assigns it to either the
    # plastic and/or viscous strain field based on whether the material is
    # plastically yielding, or the total strain field used in the visco
    # plastic material model. The implementation of this property is

    # A comma separated list of visualization objects that should be run

    # temperature. However, one frequently wants to also visualize derived
    # quantities, such as the thermodynamic phase that corresponds to a given
    # temperature-pressure value, or the corresponding seismic wave speeds.
    # The visualization objects do exactly this: they compute such derived
    # quantities and place them into the output file. The current parameter is
    # the place where you decide which of these additional output variables
    # you want to have in your output file.
    # 
    # The following postprocessors are available:
    # 
    # `ISA rotation timescale': A visualization output object that generates
    # output showing the timescale for the rotation of grains toward the
    # infinite strain axis. Kaminski and Ribe (2002, Gcubed) call this
    # quantity $\tau_{ISA}$ and define it as $\tau_{ISA} \approx
    # \frac{1}{\dot{\epsilon}}$ where $\dot{\epsilon}$ is the largest
    # eigenvalue of the strain rate tensor. It can be used, along with the
    # grain lag angle $\Theta$, to calculate the grain orientation lag
    # parameter.
    # 
    # `Vp anomaly': A visualization output object that generates output
    # showing the percentage anomaly in the seismic compressional wave speed
    # $V_p$ as a spatially variable function with one value per cell. This
    # anomaly is either shown as a percentage anomaly relative to the
    # reference profile given by adiabatic conditions (with the compositions
    # given by the current composition, such that the reference could
    # potentially change through time), or as a percentage change relative to
    # the laterally averaged velocity at the depth of the cell. This velocity
    # is calculated by linear interpolation between average values calculated
    # within equally thick depth slices. The number of depth slices in the
    # domain is user-defined. Typically, the best results will be obtained if
    # the number of depth slices is balanced between being large enough to
    # capture step changes in velocities, but small enough to maintain a
    # reasonable number of evaluation points per slice. Bear in mind that
    # lateral averaging subsamples the finite element mesh. Note that this
    # plugin requires a material model that provides seismic velocities.
    # 
    # `Vs anomaly': A visualization output object that generates output
    # showing the percentage anomaly in the seismic shear wave speed $V_s$ as
    # a spatially variable function with one value per cell. This anomaly is
    # either shown as a percentage anomaly relative to the reference profile
    # given by adiabatic conditions (with the compositions given by the
    # current composition, such that the reference could potentially change
    # through time), or as a percentage change relative to the laterally
    # averaged velocity at the depth of the cell. This velocity is calculated
    # by linear interpolation between average values calculated within equally

    # of evaluation points per slice. Bear in mind that lateral averaging
    # subsamples the finite element mesh. Note that this plugin requires a
    # material model that provides seismic velocities.
    # 
    # `adiabat': A visualization output object that generates adiabatic
    # temperature, pressure, density, and density derivative as produced by
    # AdiabaticConditions.
    # 
    # `artificial viscosity': A visualization output object that generates
    # output showing the value of the artificial viscosity on each cell.
    # 
    # `artificial viscosity composition': A visualization output object that
    # generates output showing the value of the artificial viscosity for a
    # compositional field on each cell.
    # 
    # `boundary indicators': A visualization output object that generates
    # output about the used boundary indicators. In a loop over the active
    # cells, if a cell lies at a domain boundary, the boundary indicator of
    # the face along the boundary is requested. In case the cell does not lie
    # along any domain boundary, the cell is assigned the value of the largest
    # used boundary indicator plus one. When a cell is situated in one of the
    # corners of the domain, multiple faces will have a boundary indicator.
    # This postprocessor returns the value of the first face along a boundary
    # that is encountered in a loop over all the faces.
    # 
    # `compositional vector': A visualization output object that outputs
    # vectors whose components are derived from compositional fields. Input
    # parameters for this postprocessor are defined in section
    # Postprocess/Visualization/Compositional fields as vectors
    # 
    # `depth': A visualization output postprocessor that outputs the depth for
    # all points inside the domain, as determined by the geometry model.
    # 
    # `dynamic topography': A visualization output object that generates
    # output for the dynamic topography at the top and bottom of the model
    # space. The approach to determine the dynamic topography requires us to
    # compute the stress tensor and evaluate the component of it in the
    # direction in which gravity acts. In other words, we compute
    # $\sigma_{rr}={\hat g}^T(2 \eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\frac 13
    # (\textrm{div}\;\mathbf u)I)\hat g - p_d$ where $\hat g = \mathbf
    # g/\|\mathbf g\|$ is the direction of the gravity vector $\mathbf g$ and
    # $p_d=p-p_a$ is the dynamic pressure computed by subtracting the
    # adiabatic pressure $p_a$ from the total pressure $p$ computed as part of
    # the Stokes solve. From this, the dynamic topography is computed using
    # the formula $h=\frac{\sigma_{rr}}{(\mathbf g \cdot \mathbf n)  \rho}$
    # where $\rho$ is the density at the cell center. For the bottom surface
    # we chose the convection that positive values are up (out) and negative
    # values are in (down), analogous to the deformation of the upper surface.
    # Note that this implementation takes the direction of gravity into
    # account, which means that reversing the flow in backward advection
    # calculations will not reverse the instantaneous topography because the
    # reverse flow will be divided by the reverse surface gravity.
    # 
    # Strictly speaking, the dynamic topography is of course a quantity that
    # is only of interest at the surface. However, we compute it everywhere to
    # make things fit into the framework within which we produce data for
    # visualization. You probably only want to visualize whatever data this
    # postprocessor generates at the surface of your domain and simply ignore
    # the rest of the data generated.
    # 
    # `error indicator': A visualization output object that generates output
    # showing the estimated error or other mesh refinement indicator as a
    # spatially variable function with one value per cell.
    # 
    # `geoid': Visualization for the geoid solution. The geoid is given by the
    # equivalent water column height due to a gravity perturbation. Units:
    # \si{\meter}.
    # 
    # `grain lag angle': A visualization output object that generates output
    # showing the angle between the ~infinite strain axis and the flow
    # velocity. Kaminski and Ribe (2002, Gcubed) call this quantity $\Theta$
    # and define it as $\Theta = \cos^{-1}(\hat{u}\cdot\hat{e})$  where
    # $\hat{u}=\vec{u}/|{u}|$, $\vec{u}$ is the local flow velocity, and
    # $\hat{e}$ is the local infinite strain axis, which we calculate as the
    # first eigenvector of the 'left stretch' tensor. $\Theta$ can be used to
    # calculate the grain orientation lag parameter.
    # 
    # `gravity': A visualization output object that outputs the gravity
    # vector.
    # 
    # `heat flux map': A visualization output object that generates output for
    # the heat flux density across the top and bottom boundary in outward
    # direction. The heat flux is computed as sum of advective heat flux and
    # conductive heat flux through Neumann boundaries, both computed as
    # integral over the boundary area, and conductive heat flux through
    # Dirichlet boundaries, which is computed using the consistent boundary
    # flux method as described in ``Gresho, Lee, Sani, Maslanik, Eaton (1987).
    # The consistent Galerkin FEM for computing derived boundary quantities in
    # thermal and or fluids problems. International Journal for Numerical
    # Methods in Fluids, 7(4), 371-394.'' If only conductive heat flux through
    # Dirichlet boundaries is of interest, the postprocessor can produce
    # output of higher resolution by evaluating the CBF solution vector
    # point-wise instead of computing cell-wise averaged values.
    # 
    # `heating': A visualization output object that generates output for all
    # the heating terms used in the energy equation.
    # 
    # `material properties': A visualization output object that generates
    # output for the material properties given by the material model.There are
    # a number of other visualization postprocessors that offer to write
    # individual material properties. However, they all individually have to
    # evaluate the material model. This is inefficient if one wants to output
    # more than just one or two of the fields provided by the material model.
    # The current postprocessor allows to output a (potentially large) subset
    # of all of the information provided by material models at once, with just
    # a single material model evaluation per output point.
    # 
    # `maximum horizontal compressive stress': A plugin that computes the
    # direction and magnitude of the maximum horizontal component of the
    # compressive stress as a vector field. The direction of this vector can
    # often be used to visualize the principal mode of deformation (e.g., at
    # normal faults or extensional margins) and can be correlated with seismic
    # anisotropy. Recall that the \textit{compressive} stress is simply the
    # negative stress, $\sigma_c=-\sigma=-\left[     2\eta
    # (\varepsilon(\mathbf u)             - \frac 13 (\nabla \cdot \mathbf u)
    # I)     + pI\right]$.
    # 
    # Following \cite{LundTownend07}, we define the maximum horizontal stress
    # direction as that \textit{horizontal} direction $\mathbf n$ that
    # maximizes $\mathbf n^T \sigma_c \mathbf n$. We call a vector
    # \textit{horizontal} if it is perpendicular to the gravity vector
    # $\mathbf g$.
    # 
    # In two space dimensions, $\mathbf n$ is simply a vector that is
    # horizontal (we choose one of the two possible choices). This direction
    # is then scaled by the size of the horizontal stress in this direction,
    # i.e., the plugin outputs the vector $\mathbf w = (\mathbf n^T \sigma_c
    # \mathbf n) \; \mathbf n$.
    # 
    # In three space dimensions, given two horizontal, perpendicular, unit
    # length, but otherwise arbitrarily chosen vectors $\mathbf u,\mathbf v$,
    # we can express $\mathbf n = (\cos \alpha)\mathbf u + (\sin\alpha)\mathbf
    # v$ where $\alpha$ maximizes the expression \begin{align*}  f(\alpha) =
    # \mathbf n^T \sigma_c \mathbf n  = (\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf
    # u)(\cos\alpha)^2    +2(\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf
    # v)(\cos\alpha)(\sin\alpha)    +(\mathbf v^T \sigma_c \mathbf
    # v)(\sin\alpha)^2.\end{align*}
    # 
    # The maximum of $f(\alpha)$ is attained where $f'(\alpha)=0$. Evaluating
    # the derivative and using trigonometric identities, one finds that
    # $\alpha$ has to satisfy the equation \begin{align*}  \tan(2\alpha) =
    # \frac{2.0\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf v}
    # {\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf u                            - \mathbf v^T
    # \sigma_c \mathbf v}.\end{align*}Since the transform
    # $\alpha\mapsto\alpha+\pi$ flips the direction of $\mathbf n$, we only
    # need to seek a solution to this equation in the interval
    # $\alpha\in[0,\pi)$. These are given by $\alpha_1=\frac 12 \arctan
    # \frac{\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf v}{\mathbf u^T \sigma_c \mathbf u -
    # \mathbf v^T \sigma_c \mathbf v}$ and $\alpha_2=\alpha_1+\frac{\pi}{2}$,
    # one of which will correspond to a minimum and the other to a maximum of
    # $f(\alpha)$. One checks the sign of $f''(\alpha)=-2(\mathbf u^T \sigma_c
    # \mathbf u - \mathbf v^T \sigma_c \mathbf v)\cos(2\alpha) - 2 (\mathbf
    # u^T \sigma_c \mathbf v) \sin(2\alpha)$ for each of these to determine
    # the $\alpha$ that maximizes $f(\alpha)$, and from this immediately
    # arrives at the correct form for the maximum horizontal stress $\mathbf
    # n$.
    # 
    # The description above computes a 3d \textit{direction} vector $\mathbf
    # n$. If one were to scale this vector the same way as done in 2d, i.e.,
    # with the magnitude of the stress in this direction, one will typically
    # get vectors whose length is principally determined by the hydrostatic
    # pressure at a given location simply because the hydrostatic pressure is
    # the largest component of the overall stress. On the other hand, the
    # hydrostatic pressure does not determine any principal direction because
    # it is an isotropic, anti-compressive force. As a consequence, there are
    # often points in simulations (e.g., at the center of convection rolls)
    # where the stress has no dominant horizontal direction, and the algorithm
    # above will then in essence choose a random direction because the stress
    # is approximately equal in all horizontal directions. If one scaled the
    # output by the magnitude of the stress in this direction (i.e.,
    # approximately equal to the hydrostatic pressure at this point), one
    # would get randomly oriented vectors at these locations with significant
    # lengths.
    # 
    # To avoid this problem, we scale the maximal horizontal compressive
    # stress direction $\mathbf n$ by the \textit{difference} between the
    # stress in the maximal and minimal horizontal stress directions. In other
    # words, let $\mathbf n_\perp=(\sin \alpha)\mathbf u - (\cos\alpha)\mathbf
    # v$ be the horizontal direction perpendicular to $\mathbf n$, then this
    # plugin outputs the vector quantity $\mathbf w = (\mathbf n^T \sigma_c
    # \mathbf n                -\mathbf n^T_\perp \sigma_c \mathbf n_\perp)
    # \; \mathbf n$. In other words, the length of the vector produced
    # indicates \textit{how dominant} the direction of maximal horizontal
    # compressive strength is.
    # 
    # Fig.~\ref{fig:max-horizontal-compressive-stress} shows a simple example
    # for this kind of visualization in 3d.

    # stress' visualization plugin. The left     figure shows a ridge-like
    # temperature anomaly. Together     with no-slip boundary along all six
    # boundaries, this     results in two convection rolls (center). The
    # maximal     horizontal compressive strength at the bottom center     of
    # the domain is perpendicular to the ridge because     the flow comes
    # together there from the left and right,     yielding a compressive force
    # in left-right direction.     At the top of the model, the flow separates
    # outward,     leading to a \textit{negative} compressive stress     in
    # left-right direction; because there is no flow     in front-back
    # direction, the compressive strength     in front-back direction is zero,
    # making the along-ridge     direction the dominant one. At the center of
    # the     convection rolls, both horizontal directions yield     the same

    # `melt fraction': A visualization output object that generates output for
    # the melt fraction at the temperature and pressure of the current point.
    # If the material model computes a melt fraction, this is the quantity
    # that will be visualized. Otherwise, a specific parametrization for batch
    # melting (as described in the following) will be used. It does not take
    # into account latent heat. If there are no compositional fields, this
    # postprocessor will visualize the melt fraction of peridotite (calculated
    # using the anhydrous model of Katz, 2003). If there is at least one
    # compositional field, the postprocessor assumes that the  first
    # compositional field is the content of pyroxenite, and will visualize the
    # melt fraction for a mixture of peridotite and pyroxenite (using the
    # melting model of Sobolev, 2011 for pyroxenite). All the parameters that
    # were used in these calculations can be changed in the input file, the
    # most relevant maybe being the mass fraction of Cpx in peridotite in the
    # Katz melting model (Mass fraction cpx), which right now has a default of
    # 15\%. The corresponding p-T-diagrams can be generated by running the
    # tests melt\_postprocessor\_peridotite and
    # melt\_postprocessor\_pyroxenite.
    # 
    # `melt material properties': A visualization output object that generates
    # output for melt related properties of the material model. Note that this
    # postprocessor always outputs the compaction pressure, but can output a
    # large range of additional properties, as selected in the ``List of
    # properties'' parameter.
    # 
    # `named additional outputs': Some material models can compute quantities
    # other than those that typically appear in the equations that \aspect{}
    # solves (such as the viscosity, density, etc). Examples of quantities
    # material models may be able to compute are seismic velocities, or other
    # quantities that can be derived from the state variables and the material
    # coefficients such as the stress or stress anisotropies. These quantities
    # are generically referred to as `named outputs' because they are given an
    # explicit name different from the usual outputs of material models.
    # 
    # This visualization postprocessor outputs whatever quantities the
    # material model can compute. What quantities these are is specific to the
    # material model in use for a simulation, and for many models in fact does
    # not contain any named outputs at all.
    # 
    # `nonadiabatic pressure': A visualization output object that generates
    # output for the non-adiabatic component of the pressure.
    # 
    # The variable that is outputted this way is computed by taking the
    # pressure at each point and subtracting from it the adiabatic pressure
    # computed at the beginning of the simulation. Because the adiabatic
    # pressure is one way of defining a static pressure background field, what
    # this visualization postprocessor therefore produces is \textit{one} way
    # to compute a \textit{dynamic pressure}. There are, however, other ways
    # as well, depending on the choice of the ``background pressure''.
    # 
    # `nonadiabatic temperature': A visualization output object that generates

    # parallel partition that every cell of the mesh is associated with.
    # 
    # `shear stress': A visualization output object that generates output for

    # compressible case. The shear stress differs from the full stress tensor
    # by the absence of the pressure.
    # 
    # `spd factor': A visualization output object that generates output for
    # the spd factor. The spd factor is a factor which scales a part of the
    # Jacobian used for the Newton solver to make sure that the Jacobian
    # remains positive definite.
    # 
    # `spherical velocity components': A visualization output object that
    # outputs the polar coordinates components $v_r$ and $v_\phi$ of the
    # velocity field in 2D and the spherical coordinates components $v_r$,
    # $v_{\phi}$ and $v_{\theta}$ of the velocity field in 3D.
    # 
    # `strain rate': A visualization output object that generates output for
    # the norm of the strain rate, i.e., for the quantity

    # tensor, i.e., for the components of the tensor $\varepsilon(\mathbf u)$
    # in the incompressible case and $\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac

    # `temperature anomaly': A visualization output postprocessor that outputs

  # points in each dimension as for example `# POINTS: 3 3'. The order of the
  # data columns has to be `x', `y', `v${}_x$' , `v${}_y$' in a 2d model and
  # `x', `y', `z', `v${}_x$' , `v${}_y$' , `v${}_z$' in a 3d model. Note that
  # the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the
  # first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second and the
  # third at last in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed
  # coordinates. If you use a spherical model, then the data will still be
  # handled as Cartesian, however the assumed grid changes. `x' will be
  # replaced by the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model,
  # `y' by the azimuth angle and `z' by the polar angle measured positive from
  # the north pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid.

  # z-axis with constant angular velocity (i.e., with a velocity that
  # increases with distance from the axis). The pressure is set to zero.
