# This parameter file tests the tidal heating plugin for a case where the
# viscosity is constant and the tidal heating is not dependent on latitude
# or longitude. 
#
# The equation implemented in this heating model is from Tobie et al. (2003) (https://doi.org/10.1029/2003JE002099),
# which is defined as:
# H= 2*(viscosity)*(time-averaged strain rate)^2/(1+((viscosity)*(tidal frequency)/(shear modulus))^2)), where
# viscosity is the viscosity derived from the material model at every point (constant in this test - 1e14 Pa s)
#
# The governing equation in the model is simplified as (density)*(specific heat capacity)*dT/dt=H, as unit of H is W/m^3.
# As expected, temperature increases with time as the convective and conductive processes are not active.
#
# The statistics show temperature of 1.94196735e2 K after 100 Myr of tidal heating and heating rate of 6.29829872e-09 W/kg.
# These match with analytical values which are 1.94196735e+02 K and 6.29829872e-09 W/kg for temperature and heating rate, respectively.
