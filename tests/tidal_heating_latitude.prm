# This parameter file tests the tidal heating plugin for a case where the
# viscosity is constant and the tidal heating is dependent on latitude.
# 
# The equation implemented in this heating model is from Tobie et al. (2003) (https://doi.org/10.1029/2003JE002099),
# which is defined as:
# H= 2*(viscosity)*(time-averaged tidal strain rate)^2/(1+((viscosity)*(tidal frequency)/(shear modulus))^2)), where
# viscosity is the viscosity derived from the material model at every point (constant in this test - 1e14 Pa s)
# The latitudinal variation of (time-averaged tidal strain rate) is simplified with cosine function between maximum tidal strain rate and minimum tidal strain rate.
# The variation can be found in Fig.3 of Nimmo et al. (2007) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2007.04.021).
#
# The governing equation in the model is simplified as (density)*(specific heat capacity)*dT/dt=H, as unit of H is W/m^3.
# As expected, temperature increases with time as the convective and conductive processes are not active.
#
# Analytical values are 2.85946709e+02 K and 1.65676318e+02 K at the pole and equator, respectively. 
# These values align with ASPECT's results within numerical accuracy. ASPECT's results are 2.86027243e+02 K and 1.65661824e+02 K at poles and equators, respectively.
