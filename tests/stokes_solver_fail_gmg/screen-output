Exception 'ExcMessage (exception_message.str())' on rank 0 on processing: 

An error occurred in file <utilities.cc> in function
(line in output replaced by default.sh script)
The violated condition was: 
    false
Additional information: 
    The iterative Stokes solver in
    StokesMatrixFreeHandlerImplementation::solve did not converge.
    
    The initial residual was: 1.169088e+14
    The final residual is: 6.633148e+03
    The required residual for convergence is: 1.169088e-21

    This error message can indicate that you have simply not allowed a
    sufficiently large number of iterations for your iterative solver to
    converge. This often happens when you increase the size of your
    problem. In such cases, the last residual will likely still be very
    small, and you can make the error go away by increasing the allowed
    number of iterations when setting up the SolverControl object that
    determines the maximal number of iterations you allow.
    
    The other situation where this error may occur is when your matrix is
    not invertible (e.g., your matrix has a null-space), or if you try to
    apply the wrong solver to a matrix (e.g., using CG for a matrix that
    is not symmetric or not positive definite). In these cases, the
    residual in the last iteration is likely going to be large.
