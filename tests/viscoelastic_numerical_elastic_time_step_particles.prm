# This test checks viscoelastic stress buildup with a
# constant strain rate and an elastic time step equal
# to the numerical time step. The fixed elastic time
# step used during the first time step is equal to the
# numerical time step. Viscoelastic stresses (sigma_xx, 
# sigma_yy, sigma_xy) are tracked with active particles. 
# The parameter file is derived from the 2D 
# viscoelastic_stress_build-up benchmark with modifications 
# to the compositional field method, resolution, end time, material properties and 
# postprocessors.
