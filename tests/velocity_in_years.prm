# We used to have a bug in that when "Use years in output instead of seconds"
# was set to "true", we would still interpret velocities given in the input
# file as in m/s. Presumably, people mean to use m/year in that case. See the
# email thread with Cedric Thieulot, subject "velocity RMS" in December 2012.
