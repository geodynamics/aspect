# Test for removing the net surface rotation in 2D spherical
# shells. Setup is identical to the 'remove_net_rotation' test,
# except we remove net surface rotation instead of volume rotation.
# The 'rotation statistics' postprocessor will show negligible
# surface angular velocity, and higher overall angular velocity
# than for 'remove_net_rotation'.
