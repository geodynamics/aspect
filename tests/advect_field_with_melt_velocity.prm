# This is a test for the advection scheme that transports
# compositional fields with the melt velocity. The material
# properties are set in such a way that the melt velocity
# is 1 m/yr and the solid velocity is 0.
# There are two compositional fields, one is transported
# with the solid velocity (the peridotite field), and one is
# transported with the melt velocity (the melt composition
# field).
# While the mass of the peridotite field should be conserved,
# the mass of the melt_composition field should decrease over
# time with a rate of 1/yr.
