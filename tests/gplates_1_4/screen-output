   Input point 1 spherical coordinates: 1.571 4.870
   Input point 1 normalized cartesian coordinates: 0.157 -0.988 -0.000
   Input point 1 rotated model coordinates: 0.000 1.000 0.000
   Input point 2 spherical coordinates: 1.571 5.240
   Input point 2 normalized cartesian coordinates: 0.503 -0.864 -0.000
   Input point 2 rotated model coordinates: -0.362 0.932 -0.000

   Model will be rotated by -170.97 degrees around axis -0.00 0.00 -1.00
   The ParaView rotation angles are: -0.00 -0.00 -170.97
   The inverse ParaView rotation angles are: -0.00 -0.00 170.97
