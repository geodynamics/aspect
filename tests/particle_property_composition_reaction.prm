# Test for the composition reaction particle property.
# One reaction occurs from reactant1 to reactant2 in
# the bottom left triangle of the domain at t=25 yrs,
# another back from reactant2 to reactant1 in the
# bottom right triangle of the domain at t=60yrs.
# An additional reaction creates reactant1 out of
# nothing (using a background field), setting it to
# a value of 1 in the top 20% of the domain.
# This is based on the van Keken et al. benchmark
