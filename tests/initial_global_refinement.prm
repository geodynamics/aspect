# This model tests if the maximum refinement function is
# applied correctly in time step zero during global refinement.
# The mesh should have the highest refinement level of 4 in the
# upper quarter of the domain, the lowest refinement level of
# 0 in the bottom quarter, and an intermediate level of 2 in
# between.
