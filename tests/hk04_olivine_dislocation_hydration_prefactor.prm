# A test case that checks the water fugacity viscous prefactor
# multiplication scheme in combination with the visco plastic material model.
# Following the flow law for wet olivine dislocation creep from
# Hirth & Kohlstaedt 2004 (10.1029/138GM06), the exact
# viscosity is calculated in python through:
# import numpy as np
# n = 3.5
# E = 520e3 J/mol
# V = 22e-6 m^3/mol
# R = 8.3144621
# P = 1e9 Pa
# r = 1.2
# edot_ii = 1e-13
# T = 1173 K
# A_disl = 1600 / 1e6 / 1e6**n / 1e6**r 1/Pa^(4.7)/s
#
# A_H2O = 2.6e-5 1/Pa
# activation_energy_H2O = 40e3 J/mol/K
# activation_volume_H2O = 10e-6 m^3/mol
#
# M_H2O = 0.01801528 kg/mol
# M_olivine = 0.1470027 kg/mol
#
# weight_fraction_h2o = 0.01
# weight_fraction_olivine = 1 - weight_fraction_h2o
# COH = (wt_fraction_h2o/M_H2O) / (weight_fraction_olivine/M_olivine) * 1e6
#
# fH2O = COH / A_H2O * np.exp((activation_energy_H2O + P*activation_volume_H2O)/(R * T))
# viscosity_analytic = 0.5 * A_disl**(-1/n) * edot_ii^((1-n)/n) * np.exp((E + P*V) / (n*R*T)) * fH2O**(-r/n)
# The viscosity should be equal to 1.00291e19, and the material model should return this viscosity.
