# This is a compressible test case that tests
# the behavior of the pressure compatibility
# mechanism in case of prescribed normal velocities
# whose integral over the boundaries is zero when
# using the exact values, but non-zero when using the
# interpolated values (i.e. constant at the top, and
# sin(x) at the bottom). This checks that the linear
# solver converges, even with a very low solver tolerance.
