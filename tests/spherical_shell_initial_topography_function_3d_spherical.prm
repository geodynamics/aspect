  # Initial topography model using a function defined in spherical coordinates.
  # Coordinates are (r, phi, theta), where phi is longitude and theta is colatitude.

  # in both longitude (phi) and colatitude (theta) directions.
  # Constants k_phi and k_theta control the spatial frequency of the variation.
  # The maximum topography height is limited to 5000 meters.
