# This is a test for using Drucker-Prager plasticity with the Steinberger material model.
# The model is set up in a more realistic Earth-like condition. The strain rate, the stress
# second invariant, and the viscosity we output in the visualization postprocessor should 
# always hold this relation: stress_second_invariant = 2 * viscosity * strain_rate.
