# This parameter file reproduces a 2D benchmark for viscoelastic deformation
# published in "Numerical modelling of magma dynamics coupled to tectonic
# deformation of lithosphere and crust" by Keller, May and Kaus, 2013,
# Geophys. J. Int., v. 195,  p. 1406-1422. The model setup and results are
# described in detail in section B.2.3 and figure B5.
#
# The test uses a vertical beam instead of the one in the original
# benchmark to check the directions of computed stress in the
# postprocessors.
#
# In addition, elasticity is switched off.
