# Test depth-dependent material model in 2d box using a file

# A description of convection in a 2d box. See the manual for more information.


# At the top, we define the number of space dimensions we would like to
# work in:
set Dimension                              = 2

# There are several global variables that have to do with what
# time system we want to work in and what the end time is. We
# also designate an output directory.
set Use years in output instead of seconds = true
set End time                               = 1.0e8
set Output directory                       = output-depth-dependent-box-file-simple

# Then there are variables that describe the tolerance of
# the linear solver as well as how the pressure should
# be normalized. Here, we choose a zero average pressure
# at the surface of the domain (for the current geometry, the
# surface is defined as the top boundary).

set Pressure normalization                 = surface
set Surface pressure                       = 0

# Then come a number of sections that deal with the setup
# of the problem to solve. The first one deals with the
# geometry of the domain within which we want to solve.
# The sections that follow all have the same basic setup
# where we select the name of a particular model (here,
# the box geometry) and then, in a further subsection,
# set the parameters that are specific to this particular
# model.

    set X extent = 3.0e6
    set Y extent = 3.0e6

# The next section deals with the initial conditions for the
# temperature (there are no initial conditions for the
# velocity variable since the velocity is assumed to always
# be in a static equilibrium with the temperature field).
# There are a number of models with the 'function' model
# a generic one that allows us to enter the actual initial
# conditions in the form of a formula that can contain
# constants. We choose a linear temperature profile that
# matches the boundary conditions defined below plus
# a small perturbation:
subsection Initial temperature model
  set Model name = function

    set Function expression = 2773.0 - z/L*(2500.0) + p*cos(k*pi*x/L)*sin(k*pi*z/L/2.0)
  end
end


# Then follows a section that describes the boundary conditions
# for the temperature. The model we choose is called 'box' and
# allows to set a constant temperature on each of the four sides
# of the box geometry. In our case, we choose something that is
# heated from below and cooled from above. (As will be seen
# in the next section, the actual temperature prescribed here
# at the left and right does not matter.)
subsection Boundary temperature model

    set Bottom temperature = 2773
    set Left temperature   = 0
    set Right temperature  = 0
    set Top temperature    = 273.0
  end
end


# We then also have to prescribe several other parts of the model such as
# which boundaries actually carry a prescribed boundary temperature, whereas
# all other parts of the boundary are insulated (i.e., no heat flux through
# these boundaries; this is also often used to specify symmetry boundaries).
# The parameters below this comment were created by the update script
# as replacement for the old 'Model settings' subsection. They can be
# safely merged with any existing subsections with the same name.

# The settings above all pertain to the description of the
# continuous partial differential equations we want to solve.
# The following section deals with the discretization of
# this problem, namely the kind of mesh we want to compute
# on. We here use a globally refined mesh without

# The final part is to specify what ASPECT should do with the
# solution once computed at the end of every time step. The
# process of evaluating the solution is called `postprocessing'
# and we choose to compute velocity and temperature statistics,
# statistics about the heat flux through the boundaries of the
# domain, and to generate graphical output files for later
# visualization. These output files are created every time
# a time step crosses time points separated by 0.01. Given
# our start time (zero) and final time (0.5) this means that
# we will obtain 50 output files.
