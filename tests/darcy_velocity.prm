# This is a test for the new advection method that advects a
# compositional field with the fluid velocity prescribed by
# Darcy's Law. Darcy's law is approximated here with:
# u_f = u_s - K_D / phi * (rho_s * g - rho_f * g)
# u_f = fluid velocity
# u_s = solid velocity
# K_D = Darcy Coefficient
# phi = porosity
# rho_f = fluid density
# rhos_s = solid density
# g = gravity
# The second term on the rhs of Darcy's Law only contributes
# to the component of the  fluid velocity parallel to the gravity
# vector, which is proportional to the buoyancy of the fluid phase.

# The initial porosity is uniform everywhere, and in the
# center of the model is a blob of 'fluid' and 'solid'.
# The solid has a prescribed x velocity, and so the fluid
# blob should be advected horizontally with the solid velocity and
# vertically as it rises up due to its buoyancy.
