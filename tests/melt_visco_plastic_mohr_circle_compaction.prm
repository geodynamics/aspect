# 2d model demonstrating implementation of the constitutive law
# described by Keller et. al., 2013, including viscoplastic yielding
# and melt migration.
#
# In this test, a velocity field is prescribed that represents
# simple shear under uniaxial extension. This setup generates
# output that describes the material model's response to a range
# of stress conditions, both in resulting effective viscosity, and in
# velocity of pore fluid flow.
