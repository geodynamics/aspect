# A variation on the 'compressibility' testcase. here, we compute not
# only the first iteration of a nonlinear fixed point scheme, but in
# fact the first several. This should iterate out the
# continuity equation,
#    div u = -1/rho drho/dp u^ . g
# and so should lead to an upward expansion of the flux.
#
# with the original testcase, the iteration does not converge. rather,
# we need a much smaller compressibility to make things converge. we
# choose a velocity profile
#   u_z = 1+z/100
# with corresponding density profile
#   rho = 1/(1+z/100)
# so that the continuity equation is satisfied. From the density one
# can compute a pressure profile (here, the pressure equals the hydrostatic
# pressure because all second derivatives of the velocity vanish). This gives
# p(z), which we can invert for z=z(p) and enter into the density equation
# to get
#   rho = 10.0/11.0*exp(pressure/100.0)
# which corresponds to compressibility=0.01. This is implemented in
# the .cc file corresponding to this testcase.
