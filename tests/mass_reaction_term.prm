# This is a model setup to test the term on the right-hand
# side of the mass conservation in models with melt
# transport that describes the change in volume associated
# with melting and freezing reactions.
# Melt flows in from the bottom and crosses a phase
# transition, where it freezes and changes the velocity.
# The crucial property of the test is the maximum velocity
# (at the bottom of the domain), which should be close to
# 2.4e-11 m/s.
#
# This is because upon melting, the density changes from
# 3000 kg/m3 to 2500 kg/m3, so the velocity increases from
# 2e-11 m/s to
#
# 2e-11 m/s * 3000/2500 = 2.4e-11 m/s.
#
# This test is similar to the
# "latent heat melt transport" test, except that it has a
# zero permeability and latent heat, and slightly different
# material properties and geometry.
