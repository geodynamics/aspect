# Analytical solution for steady-state:
# Domain size [0, L] with L=0.1 m
# Conductivity k=10 W/m/K
# Bottom boundary T=373
# Top boundary: Robin boundary with k dT/dz(L) + h (T(L) - T_inf) = 0
# Heat transfer coefficient h = 100 W/m^2/K
# Bottom "fluid" temperature T_inf = 293 K
# no other heat sources, only diffusion

# Solution: T(z) = 373 - 400 z [K]
# Temperature at the top should be 333 K 
# and can be compared to min value from temperature statistics postprocessor.

# The heat flux through the top boundary should be
# q = k * dT/dz * Ltop = 10 W/m/K * 400 K/m * 0.01 = 40 W/m
# (since it is a 2-D model, the unit of the heat flux computed here is
# technically W/m, but the postprocessor reports it as W)
