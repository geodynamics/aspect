# This test has the same setup as test 2, but now the two components both contain quartz.
# We slightly smooth the property lookup table to avoid the infinite specific heat at 
# the Qtz->Coesite univariant reaction. 
# This is an edge case where the two assemblages with the same univariant reaction can vary
# their entropy freely without changing T.
# This test shows that the multicomponent averaging method can well solve such edge cases
# using a slightly smoothed property lookup table.
