# This model tests the implementation of phase transitions in the 
# multicomponent compressible material model, where there are two 
# compositional fields and a background field that each experience 
# a different number of phase transitions. 
# 
# The viscosity and density change across specified phase boundaries,
# while other material properties stay constant. The correct changes 
# in density and viscosity across the phase boundaries are readily
# apparent in the test solution file.
#
# The test is a modified copy of visco_plastic_phases_compositions.prm, 
# which uses the incompressible multicomponent equation of state model.
