# Test that when we do material model averaging, that the material
# model parameters such as the viscosity are also averaged when output
# in graphical format. We want to do this because we want to visualize
# what these parameters really are to the computational model, not
# what they are in a pointwise sense before the computational model
# gets to see them.
#
# This test uses the SolKz model, which has a viscosity that grows
# exponentially in z-direction. The various output_averaging_*prm
# files then simply apply different cellwise averaging options to
# this viscosity.
