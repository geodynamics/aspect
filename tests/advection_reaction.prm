# This is a benchmark case that tests the operator split 
# solver scheme, which can use a different time step to
# compute reactions between compositional fields than 
# the time step used for advection.  
# In comparison to the example 'exponential_decay', the
# initial composition depends on x, and there is a constant 
# horizontal velocity. The composition decays over time, 
# following the equations for exponential decay with a decay 
# rate that depends on y.

# As we split the time-stepping of advection and reactions,

# We control the advection time step using the 'Maximum time step'
# parameter (for easy comparison with the exponential decay test 
# case), and the reaction time step using the 'Reaction time step' 
# parameter. We will vary both parameters in different model runs.
