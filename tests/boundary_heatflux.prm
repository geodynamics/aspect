# This test is used to check if the heat flux boundary conditions
# work correctly. It prescribes a zero heat flux at the sides, a 
# basal heat flow of 4 mW/m^2 and a surface temperature of 90 K. 
# Presently, we use a conductivity of 
# 2.38 (the conductivity of ice at 273 K). This test should yield a 
# temperature of approximately 420 K at the base of the model.   

#           Ts = 90 K
