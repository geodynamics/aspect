# A testcase that demonstrates shear thinning. It solves the
# equations on a box with Dirichlet boundary conditions equal to
# (z,0), which then is also the velocity everywhere. This yields
# a constant strain rate [[0,1/2],[1/2,0]] with norm |dot eps|=1/sqrt(2).
#
# We then have a viscosity that depends on
# the strain rate as eta=1/(1+|dot eps|). Because the strain rate
# is constant, so is the viscosity.
#
# In this version of the testcase, we only run a single Advection and a single Stokes step,
# so the viscosity we use for the first velocity step is eta=1.
# We can only tell that the correct viscosity is computed in a
# postprocessor, which we implement in the .cc file. The correct
# value that needs to be computed is viscosity=1/(1+|dot eps|),
# i.e., viscosity=0.585786
