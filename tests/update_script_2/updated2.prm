# This test is a modified copy of update_script.prm.
# It differs from update_script.prm by applying the update script twice,
# and checking that it does not add additional lines after the
# first run.

# The content of this prm file is only executable by ASPECT <=1.5, but the
# corresponding shared library in update_script.cc will first execute the
# update script on this .prm file before running ASPECT with the updated
# version of the file. The success of this test means the script did its job
# and ASPECT 2.0 is able to read the twice updated file and the twice updated
# file does not differ from the once updated file.
