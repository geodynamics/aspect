# This somewhat specific test checks the diffusion dislocation
# rheology model (with Hirth and Kohlstedt (2004) parameters
# for dry olivine).
# It sets up a 2D Cartesian box with two different materials
# inside. Both materials are olivine, but the second has an
# adjusted density. The starting temperature is a typical
# geotherm. The top and bottom boundaries are held at fixed
# temperature, and all boundaries have tangential velocity
# boundary conditions.
