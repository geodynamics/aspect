# This test verifies implementation of prescribed solutions interface.
# It sets up a 2D convection problem in a spherical chunk with 
# prescribed velocity conditions. A prescribed velocity function is 
# applied that varies with space and time to set the flow field.
# The time unit "year" is being used instead of "second" to test
# the converting of units.
