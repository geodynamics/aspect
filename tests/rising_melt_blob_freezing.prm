# This is a test for the melting rate functionality,
# in particular the freezing of melt.
# It uses the melt simple model.

# The initial porosity has the form of a Gaussian function
# there is a fixed (constant) freezing rate.

# The amplitude of the Gaussian is 0.2, and the melting time
# scale is chosen in such a way that the fraction of melt
# should be cut in half every year (visible in the maximum
# value of the porosity field).
