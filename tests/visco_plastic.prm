# A simple model to test if the visco_plastic material
# model returns the correct viscosity for the specified
# viscous flaws, brittle parameters and geotherm. The 
# model (100x100 km) contains two distinct materials
# (crust & mantle), with the crust (upper 30 km) specified
# by a compositional field. The specified geotherm is typical
# of the continental lithosphere. The top and bottom boundaries  
# have fixed temepratures (sides are insulating), while all the
# boundaries are free-slip (tangential velocity b.c.). The strain-rate 
# used in the viscous flow laws is specified in the material model
# As we only want to check the viscosity profile, no need to do more
# than 1 nonlinear iteration. See additional comments below for more details.
