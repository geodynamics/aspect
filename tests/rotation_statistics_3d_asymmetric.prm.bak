# This test is based on rotation_statistics_3D, with the modification
# that we create a rotating sphere with an asymmetric density distribution.
# More precisely the density is 2 if (x>0 && y>0) or (x<0 && y<0), and 1 otherwise.
# This allows us to compute the xy entry of the moment of inertia tensor I as
# a sum of a full sphere with density 1 (for which I_xy == 0) and two
# anomalies in the first and third quadrant of the x-y plane with delta_rho=1:
#
# I_xy = -1 * \int_V delta_rho * x * y dV
#      = -1 * \int_V (r*cos(phi)*sin(theta) * r*sin(phi)*sin(theta)) dV
#      = -2 * \int_(phi=0)^(pi/2) \int_(theta=0)^(pi) \int_(r=0)^(R)
#        r^2 sin(phi) cos(phi) sin^2(theta) * r^2 sin(theta) dr dtheta dphi
#      = -4/15 R^5 = -0.266666
#
# This is mostly a test that the 'rotation statistics' postprocessor
# correctly computes this moment of inertia tensor (including the correct
# sign).
