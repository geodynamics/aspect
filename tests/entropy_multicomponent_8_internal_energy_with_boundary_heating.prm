# This file tests whether the heat added to the model can be correctly converted 
# to internal energy, following the relation: Delta U = T * Delta S - P * Delta V, P = 0
# There is a constant heat flux flowing in from the bottom. Thermal conductivity is set
# to a very high value, so that the temperature everywhere is almost the same.
# The error converges to zero as the time step length reduces.
