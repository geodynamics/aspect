# This test is based on prescribed_stokes_solution, with the modification
# that we create a rotating sphere. The velocity is prescribed with a angular velocity
# of 1, and this is mostly a test that the 'rotation statistics' postprocessor
# correctly computes this angular velocity w, and the corresponding angular
# momentum L = I * w. Since the moment of inertia I of a 3D sphere is
#
# I = 2/5 M R^2 = 2/5 rho V R^2 = 2/5 rho * 4/3 PI R^3 R^2
#
# with rho=1 and R=1: I = 2/5 * 4/3 * PI = 1.675516
#
# and with the angular velocity w=1 the angular momentum we expect
# L = I = 1.675516. The test output is slightly off, but converges with
# increasing resolution towards this value.
