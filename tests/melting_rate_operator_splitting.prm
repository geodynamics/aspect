# This is a test for the melting rate functionality, 
# and it is similar to the melting_rate, but uses
# operator splitting and latent heat of melting.  

# We set the temperature in such a way that the initial 
# equilibrium melt fraction would be 0.2, but due to 
# latent heat effects, the temperature gets reduced and
# the final melt fraction should be 0.1. 
# Likewise, the temperature should be reduced from 1000.2
# to 1000.1.
