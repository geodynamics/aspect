# but with less mesh refinement



############### Global parameters
# We use a 3d setup. Since we are only interested
# in a steady state solution, we set the end time
# equal to the start time to force a single time
# step before the program terminates.

set Use years instead of seconds           = false

############### Parameters describing the model
# The setup is a 3d box with edge length 2890000 in which
# all 6 sides have free slip boundary conditions. Because
# the temperature plays no role in this model we need not
# bother to describe temperature boundary conditions or
# the material parameters that pertain to the temperature.

############### Parameters describing the compositional field
# This, however, is the more important part: We need to describe
# the compositional field and its influence on the density
# function. The following blocks say that we want to
# advect a single compositional field and that we give it an
# initial value that is zero outside a sphere of radius
# r=200000m and centered at the point (p,p,p) with
# p=1445000 (which is half the diameter of the box) and one inside.
# The last block re-opens the material model and sets the
# density differential per unit change in compositional field to
# 100.

############### Parameters describing the discretization
# The following parameters describe how often we want to refine
# the mesh globally and adaptively, what fraction of cells should
# be refined in each adaptive refinement step, and what refinement
# indicator to use when refining the mesh adaptively.

# The final section allows us to choose which postprocessors to
# run at the end of each time step. We select to generate graphical
# output that will consist of the primary variables (velocity, pressure,
# temperature and the compositional fields) as well as the density and
# viscosity. We also select to compute some statistics about the
# velocity field.
