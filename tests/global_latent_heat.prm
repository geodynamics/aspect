# This is a test for the latent heat of melt heating model
# and its interaction with other heating plugins.
# A constant heating rate is described using the function
# heating model, and this heating should lead to melting
# of approximately 0.01/s (so that the maximum porosity at
# the end of the model run (t=1s) should be approximately
# 1%. In practice, this value is slightly lower because
# some heat is also used to increase the temperature of
# the material.
