   Input point 1 spherical coordinates: 1.000 1.870
   Input point 1 normalized cartesian coordinates: -0.248 0.804 0.540
   Input point 1 rotated model coordinates: 0.000 1.000 -0.000
   Input point 2 spherical coordinates: 2.000 5.240
   Input point 2 normalized cartesian coordinates: 0.458 -0.786 -0.416
   Input point 2 rotated model coordinates: -0.243 -0.970 0.000

   Model will be rotated by -154.50 degrees around axis -0.06 0.95 0.31
   The ParaView rotation angles are: 32.70 148.06 17.14
   The inverse ParaView rotation angles are: 36.45 -152.58 -1.64
