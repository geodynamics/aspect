# A test for using the adiabatic pressure in plastic
# viscosity calculation for the visco_plastic
# material model. In this example, the adiabatic pressure is 3.3e9 Pa
# (= rho * g * depth = 3300 * 10 * 100e3) at the bottom. So, the
# predicted yield stress can be calculated by the
# following equation:
#
#   eta_yield = cos(phi) * coh + sin(phi) * pressure
#
#  eta_yield         # yield stress (Pa)
#  phi  = 10         # angle of internal friction (degrees)
#  coh  = 1e6        # cohesion (Pa)
#  p    = 3.3e9      # pressure (Pa)

# Using these parameter we expect a yield stress of 5.7402e8 Pa at y=0 (P=3.3e9)
# which is confirmed in the output. Note that the pressure in this model is
# close to 0 (because there is no gravity), and we prescribe the adiabatic
# pressure to the value above. So the fact that we match the correct yield
# stress shows we are using the adiabatic pressure instead of actual pressure
# to compute the yield stress.
