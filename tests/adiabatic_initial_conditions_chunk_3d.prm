# This parameter file tests the adiabatic initial conditions
# implemented for the chunk geometry.
# The 3D chunk geometry has a 30/30 degree opening angle in
# longitude/latitude.
# A 50 K spherical perturbation of radius 500 km is applied
# in the middle of the inner boundary.
#
# This test is based on adiabatic_initial_conditions.prm
