# Test TimeStepping plugin "repeat on cutback" by having a change in
# prescribed surface velocity in combination with the advection
# of particles. There are two compositional fields, one based on
# the field method and one on the particle method. The initial condition
# for the fields is the same (identical to the temperature field).
# For sufficient mesh and particle resolution,
# the end result for the two fields should be practically the same.
# Same as time_stepping_repeat_particles.prm except for the prescribed
# boundary velocity and the iterative Advection scheme.
# For this scheme, the particle positions and properties
# have to be restored before each second or later nonlinear iteration
# within a timestep. The sudden change in surface velocity is
# less extreme so that the second temperature nonlinear iteration after
# the change still converges.
