# SMOOTHING - COMPOSITIONAL PASSIVE
# This is a test based off of that composition-passive.prm file.
# All settings are exactly the same with the exception
# that we are using entropy viscosity with smoothing,
# and that things were made slightly simpler to make
# the test run faster.
#
# See the manual for more information about this setup.
