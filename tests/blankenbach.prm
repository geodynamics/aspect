# Listing of Parameters
# ---------------------
# This case is identical to case 1a from the Blankenbach Benchmark
# (Blankenbach 1989). Cases b and c can be run by changing the
# Viscosity to 1e-5 and 1e-6, respectively, which leads to the
# corresponding change of the Rayleigh number from 1e4 to 1e5 and
# 1e6. This test essentially resembles the convection-box cookbook
# and reproduces its results very closely (a slight difference results
# from the different refinement levels).
# The relevant output is the vrms velocity and the heat flux through
# the top boundary, which in this setup is identical to the Nu number.
