# This test checks viscoelastic stress buildup with a
# constant strain rate, an elastic time step equal
# to the numerical time step and a yield stress of 10 MPa.
# The fixed elastic time step used during the first time
# step is equal to the numerical time step. Viscoelastic
# stresses (sigma_xx, sigma_yy, sigma_xy) are tracked with
# compositional fields. The yield stress of 10 MPa should
# prevent elastic stresses from accumulating above this
# value. The parameter file is derived from the 2D
# viscoelastic_stress_build-up benchmark with modifications
# to the resolution, end time, material properties and
# postprocessors. Notably, other tests derived from the same
# benchmark have a cohesion of 1e6 Pa, run for 1 time step
# (End time = 1e3), and only do 1 nonlinear iteration. Here,
# we have adjusted the parameters slightly to illustrate that
# in some cases the solution may not change at all between nonlinear
# iterations and as a result no Stokes linear iterations are
# performed.
