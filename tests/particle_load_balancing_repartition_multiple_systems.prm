# A test for the particle load balancing strategy 'repartition'
# when multiple particle worlds are active.
# The test is balanced to show that the cell weight used for
# the repartition algorithm is exactly 1000 and only added once
# from the first particle world. The test domain is split into
# two particle worlds, one containing particles in the upper
# right quarter of the domain, the other covering the rest of
# the domain. The particle weights are chosen so that
# for a cell weight of 1000 the integrated weight from the
# upper right quarter of the domain equals the integrated
# weight from the other three quarters, which leads to a
# cell distribution between the two processes of 16:48,
# which can be seen in the output.

# MPI: 2
