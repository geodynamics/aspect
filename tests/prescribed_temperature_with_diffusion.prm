# A testcase that demonstrates that interpolating material model
# outputs into the temperature field and diffusing it works.
#
# The property copied into the temperature field
# is a Gaussian with an amplitude of 1, namely exp(-0.5*x*x).
# We choose the diffusion length scale in a way that its amplitude
# should be reduced to 0.95 when the diffusion equation is solved.
