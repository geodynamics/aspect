# This test is a modification of the composite_viscous_outputs test
# that adds a minimum and maximum viscosity limiter with values
# that are somewhat close. It documents the behavior of the rheology
# for this case, which is that when the maximum viscosity (here 4e18)
# approaches the minimum viscosity (1e18) the effective maximum and
# minimum viscosities are different from the ones prescribed in
# the input file (1.33e18 and 5.33e18 in this test).
