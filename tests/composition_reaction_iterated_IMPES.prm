# This is a variation of the composition_reaction test,
# with the exception that we use a reaction term that
# requires the iterated Advection and Stokes solver scheme to reach the
# correct reaction rate, which is one for the second
# field and the value of the second field for the first
# and the third field. Without iterating, the fields will
# use the value from the previous time step. In addition,
# this test checks if the results are the same for the
# first and third field, independent of the order of
# solving, and thus if our solver scheme is consistent.
