# This test is used to check if the shear heating
# of melt, in particular the compression heating heating, is
# calculated correctly.
# There is no driving force in form of gravity in this model,
# but material is melting homogeneously with a constant rate,
# and the top boundary of the model is open, allowing material
# to flow out (material expands upon melting).
# There is no shear in the solid itself or shear between melt
# and solid, but the velocity divergence is nonzero (it is 0.1),
# so there is compression heating \xi (\nabla \cdot u_s).
#
# With the material properties in this benchmark, shear
# heating of melt should have a value of 1.0 (for the
# Total shear heating with melt rate).
#
# At the top, we define the number of space dimensions we would like to
# work in:
set Dimension                              = 2
set Nonlinear solver scheme                = iterated Advection and Stokes

# There are several global variables that have to do with what
# time system we want to work in and what the end time is.
