# Like 'no_adiabatic_heating_02' but here we actually switch on friction
# heating and set the viscosity to a non-zero. In this testcase, we have
#   u_z(z) = 1+z/10
# so in 2d, we have
#   eps(u) - 1/3 (div u) I = [[-1/30,0], [0,2/30]]
# so the friction heating term is
#   2*eta*5/9*(1/10)^2
# From the velocity, we get
#   z = t+t^2/20
# Consequently, if we set the thermal diffusivity to zero and c_P=1, then from
#   rho(t) DT/Dt = 2*eta*5/9*(1/10)^2
# we get
#   T(t)  = \int_0^t 2*eta*5/9*(1/10)^2 / rho(t) dt
# Now,
#   rho(t) = rho(z(t)) = rho(t+t^2/20) = 1/(1+u_z(z(t))
#          = 1/(1+(t+t^2/20)/10)
# so
#   T(t)  = eta/90 * (t + t^2/20 + t^3/600)
# We can reformulate this in terms of z as
#   T(z)  = eta/1350 * [(z+20)*sqrt(25+5z) - 100]
# Thus, the maximal temperature at the outlet should be
#   T(1)  = 0.011*eta
# To make all of this work, of course, we need that the density does
# not depend on the temperature
#
# In this testcase, we choose eta=10, so this should lead to
#   T(1)  = 0.1112
