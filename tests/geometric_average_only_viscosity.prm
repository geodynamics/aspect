# This is a setup to test geometric averaging of the viscosity
# and that it works with the GMG.
# The viscosity in the model decreases exponentially from left to
# right from 1e14 Pa s to 1e10 Pa s. The model has two cells, so
# using the geometric average only for the viscosity should lead
# to a viscosity of 1e11 in the cells on the left and 1e13 in the
# cells on the right.
