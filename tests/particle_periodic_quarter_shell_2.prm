# This test adapts tests/particle_periodic_quarter_shell.prm to test the particle
# handling at periodic boundaries in the polar direction for a quarter
# spherical shell geometry.
# The velocity and the initial particle locations are prescribed so that we know
# where particles should end up. The time step size is precribed in such a way
# that particles at the outer boundary should move exactly half of a cell in
# angular direction in each time step, and particles at the inner boundary move
# exactly a quarter of a cell in angular direction in each time step.
# (There are 96 cells in longitudinal direction.)
