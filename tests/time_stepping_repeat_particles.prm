# Test TimeStepping plugin "repeat on cutback" by having a change in
# prescribed surface velocity in combination with the advection
# of particles. There are two compositional fields, one based on
# the field method and one on the particle method. The initial condition
# for the fields is the same (idenical to the temperature field).
# For sufficient mesh and particle resolution,
# the end result for the two fields should be practically the same.
