# This test is used to check if the latent heat of
# melting of pyroxenite is calculated correctly. 
# The material is upwelling with a constant velocity
# (without separation of melt and solid) and without
# conduction of heat, so that the steady state of the 
# model is an adiabatic temperature profile. An approximated
# analytical solution for this profile to compare the solution 
# to can be calculated analogue to the description in Katz 
# et al., 2003 (A new parameterization of hydrous mantle melting)
# by numerically integrating equation (23) of that paper and 
# using the corresponding parameters of the pyroxenite melting
# parameterization from Sobolev et al., 2011 (Linking mantle plumes,
# large igneous provinces and environmental catastrophes).
