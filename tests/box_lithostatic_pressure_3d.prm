# - "open boundary" - for a sinking sphere.



############### Global parameters
# We use a 3d setup. Since we are only interested
# in a steady state solution, we set the end time
# equal to the start time to force a single time
# step before the program terminates.

set Dimension                              = 3
set Start time                             = 0

############### Parameters describing the model
# The setup is a 3d box with edge length 2890000 in which
# all sides except the left have free slip boundary conditions. Because
# the temperature plays no role in this model we need not
# bother to describe temperature boundary conditions or
# the material parameters that pertain to the temperature.

############### Parameters describing the compositional field
# This, however, is the more important part: We need to describe

# function. The following blocks say that we want to
# advect a single compositional field and that we give it an
# initial value that is zero outside a sphere of radius
# r=200000m and centered at the point (p,p,p) with
# p=1445000 (which is half the diameter of the box) and one inside.
# The last block re-opens the material model and sets the
# density differential per unit change in compositional field to
# 100.
