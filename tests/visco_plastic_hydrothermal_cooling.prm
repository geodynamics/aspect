# This is a test for enhanceing the thermal conductivity (k)
# due to the effect of hydrothermal circulation.
# k_eff = k0 * (1+ (Nu-1)*exp(2-T/T_cutoff-Depth/D_cutoff))
# k_eff is the effective thermal conductivity, k0 is the reference
# thermal conductivity, Nu is the Nusselt number, T_cutoff and
# D_cutoff are the reference cutoff temperature and refence cutoff
# depth, respectively. Here, the returned k_eff should rise
# exponentially from 2 at the bottom (depth = 100e3) to 3.71828
# at the surface (depth = 0) for the composition 1 and from 4 at
#the bottom to 7.43656 at the surface for the composition 2.
