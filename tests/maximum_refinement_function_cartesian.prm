# Listing of Parameters
# ---------------------
# In order to make the problem in the first time step easier to solve, we need
# a reasonable guess for the temperature and pressure. To obtain it, we use an
# adiabatic pressure and temperature field. This parameter describes what the
# `adiabatic' temperature would be at the surface of the domain (i.e. at depth
# zero). Note that this value need not coincide with the boundary condition
# posed at this point. Rather, the boundary condition may differ significantly
# from the adiabatic value, and then typically induce a thermal boundary
# layer.
# For more information, see the section in the manual that discusses the
# general mathematical model.
