# The settings below will cause the residual based entropy viscosity to always
# be higher than the maximum viscosity. Since the minimum of both is chosen as
# the applied stabilization, the output will be equal to the latter. For a
# uniform box, and all material parameters and velocity chosen as one, the
# maximum viscosity should be equal to the cell diameter (i.e. sqrt(1+1)),
# which was verified for this test.
