# This is a compressible test case that shall
# test the behavior of the pressure compatibility
# mechanism in case of prescribed normal velocities
# integrated over the boundaries. It is converging
# in this setup, but if the solver tolerance is
# decreased or the prescribed normal velocity is
# increased it fails to converge, which is exactly
# the behavior we intend.
