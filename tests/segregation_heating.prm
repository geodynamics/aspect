# This test is used to check if the shear heating
# of melt, in particular the segregation heating, is
# calculated correctly.
# There is no in- or outflux of solid material, but melt
# is allowed to flow in freely, so that it moves upwards
# with a constant velocity determined by its buoyancy.
# Hence there is no shear of the solid material, but there
# is dissipation due to the segregation of melt:
# \eta_f porosity^2 / permeability * (u_f - u_s)^2.
#
# With the material properties in this benchmark, shear
# heating of melt should have a value of 0.78125 (for the
# Total shear heating with melt rate).
#
# At the top, we define the number of space dimensions we would like to
# work in:

set Nonlinear solver scheme                = iterated Advection and Stokes

# There are several global variables that have to do with what
# time system we want to work in and what the end time is.
