# This is a model setup to test the latent heat generation,
# similar to the test latent_heat.
# Material flows in from the top and crosses a phase
# transition, where energy is released and the temperature
# increases. The energy release in this model is calculated
# from a lookup table for enthalpy values and the enthalpy
# is evaluated at the edges of each cell instead of the
# quadrature point to catch even very sharp transitions.
# The steady-state result is around 10 % off the original
# test, because the data table was created as small as
# possible.
# A similar testcase is also described in the latent heat
# cookbook, and the predicted temperature solution at the
# bottom of the model is the same (T2 = 1107.39 K).
