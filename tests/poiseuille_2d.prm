# A simple Poiseuille flow example in which we prescribe the velocity to
# be (z*(z-1),0)^T and see what pressure we get. We switch off gravity
# so the pressure is purely the dynamic pressure. It is only determined
# up to a constant, and with a viscosity of eta=1, should be between
# +2 at the left inlet and -2 at the right outlet.
