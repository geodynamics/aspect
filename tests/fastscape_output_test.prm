# This test verifies Fastscape output options. The output options include uplift, kd, 
# and kf (the default output is kf as in previous version). 
# The results would be shown in the Fastscape vtu files.
# The test results shows the kd distribution for both onshore and offshore.
# Enable if: ASPECT_WITH_FASTSCAPE
