# A variation on the 'compressibility_iterated_stokes' testcase.
# We use it to test the volumetric strain rate visualization postprocessor.
#
# As the testcase has the analytical solution
#   u_z = 1+z/10
# with corresponding density profile
#   rho = 1/(1+z/10),
# the volumetric strain rate should be 0.1 throughout the whole domain.
