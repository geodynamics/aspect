# A test to check whether the calculated finite strain invariant
# (total strain in this case) does not unrealistically accumulate during
# nonlinear iterations when an iterative Advection scheme is used. We
# check this by running the postprocessors on every nonlinear iteration.
# The test output from the composition statistics postprocessor,
# which prints out min/max/mass of each compositional field, confirms
# that the total strain does not incorrectly accumulate during successive
# nonlinear iterations.
# The test has been slightly modified from the test linked below.
