# This test checks whether the temperature strain healing mechanism,
# located in source/material_model/rheology/strain_dependent.cc,
# works as intended when the total strain (invariant) is tracked.
#
# In the setup below, an initial amount of strain (0.2) is applied
# uniformly throughout the domain via the initial composition subsection.
# The model contains a uniform initial temperature (273 K) and no-slip BC
# to produce no movement throughout the model domain. This ensures that
# no additional strain accumulates and the value of the compositional
# tracking the total strain invariant will strictly dependent on the
# temperature-dependent strain healing parameters.
#
# The temperature-dependent strain healing is formulated as:
#   healed_strain = strain_healing_temperature_dependent_recovery_rate *
#                   exp( -strain_healing_temperature_dependent_prefactor *
#                        0.5 * ( 1.0 - temperature/reference_temperature ) ) *
#                   time
#
# Above, the parameters strain_healing_temperature_dependent_recovery_rate
# and strain_healing_temperature_dependent_prefactor are user-defined
# values set to, respectively, 1.e-15 and 15. The parameter reference_temperature
# is equal to the user-specified adiabatic surface temperature, which is
# set to 273 K. The variable time simply refers to how long the model
# has run.
#
# The model runs for 8 millions years with 2 million year time steps.
# The analytical prediction for the value of the compositional field
# total_strain at this time is:
#   0.2 - (1e-15 * exp(-15. * 0.5 * (1.0 - 273/293))*8.e6*31556952.0) ~= 0.04869
#
# However, the predicted (~ 0.01087) and calculated (0.02884) values diverge
# after an additional time step (model run time = 10 Myr). This is likely due
# to artificts (numerical diffusion) in the advection equation arising when
# handling small numbers, as changing the time step to 10 Myr produces
# matching predicted and calculated values at 10 Myr (e.g., after one time step).
#
# Note that 31556952.0 represents the conversion from years to seconds.
#
# The calculated value can be observed directly in the file screen-output, as the
# composition statistics postprocessor is used. For future debugging purposes,
# the time step is limited to 1e6 years and both statistics and solution files
# are output as well.
