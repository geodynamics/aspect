TimerOutput objects finalize timed values printed to the
screen by communicating over MPI in their destructors.
Since an exception is currently uncaught, this
synchronization (and subsequent output) will be skipped
to avoid a possible deadlock.


Exception 'ExcMessage("The time step length for the each time step needs to be positive, " "but the computed step length of the \"function\" plugin was: " + std::to_string(new_time_step) + ".")' on rank 0 on processing: 

An error occurred in file <function.cc> in function
(line in output replaced by default.sh script)
The violated condition was: 
    new_time_step > 0
Additional information: 
    The time step length for the each time step needs to be positive, but the computed step length of the "function" plugin was: -1.000000.

Aborting!
