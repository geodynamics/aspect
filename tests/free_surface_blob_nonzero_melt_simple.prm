# Test for free surface topography due to a rising blob
# with melt transport = on and nonzero porosity.
# The test is the same as free_surface_blob_melt, except that melt
# has a nonzero initial condition. 
# We test if the boundary coditions for melt are set correctly
# (no melt flowing in/out at the free surface) by checking if the
# mass of the porosity field is conserved.
