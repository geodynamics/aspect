# This is a test for the melting rate functionality
# It uses a new material model similar to the melt
# simple model, but with a different melting rate.

# The melting rate has the form of a Gaussian function 
# and every timestep a fixed amount of material is melting. 

# The amplitude of the Gaussian is 0.0001, so both the 
# porosity and the peridotite field should increase by
# this amount (visible in the maximum value).

# Note that the maximum porosity can deviate slightly, 
# as additional melt is created bx compaction.
