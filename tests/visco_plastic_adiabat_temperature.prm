# A test for adding an adiabatic temperature gradient to the temperature
# in the flow laws for the visco_plastic material model.
# This is useful for incompressible models that do not include an adiabatic
# temperature gradient.
# This test modifies the visco_plastic_diffusion_dislocation_composite test
# by adding a temperature gradient to the otherwise uniform temperature (1573).
# The gradient is added in terms of pressure rather than depth.
# Using a pressure gradient of 32436 Pa/m, then a value of
# 0.3 K/km = 0.0003 K/m = 9.24e-09 K/Pa gives an earth-like adiabat.
# At the surface P = 3e9 Pa (as defined in original test) so Tv = T + Tad ~ 1600
# strain-rate = 4.48e-16 (from applied pure shear) and eta-comp ~ 3.43e18 Pa s.
# At the bottom of the box (100 km, P = 3e9 + 3300*100e3*10 = 6.3e9 Pa, with g = 10 m/s^2)
# In the test, there is some dynamic pressure, so the pressure at the bottom is 6.15e9 Pa
# For this pressure, eta-comp ~ 20.016e18 Pa s
