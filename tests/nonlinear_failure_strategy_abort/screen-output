WARNING: The nonlinear solver in the current timestep failed to converge.
Acting according to the parameter 'Nonlinear solver failure strategy'...
Aborting simulation as requested.
TimerOutput objects finalize timed values printed to the
screen by communicating over MPI in their destructors.
Since an exception is currently uncaught, this
synchronization (and subsequent output) will be skipped
to avoid a possible deadlock.


Exception 'ExcNonlinearSolverNoConvergence()' on rank 0 on processing: 

An error occurred in file <solver_schemes.cc> in function
(line in output replaced by default.sh script)
The violated condition was: 
    nonlinear_solver_control.last_check() != SolverControl::failure
Additional information: 
    Nonlinear solver failed to converge in the prescribed number of steps.
    Consider changing `Max nonlinear iterations` or `Nonlinear solver
    failure strategy`.
