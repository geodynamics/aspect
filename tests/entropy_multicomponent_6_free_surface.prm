# This tests whether the multicomponent averaging method works with a free surface.
# A pipe with a free top surface and an open bottom boundary. Material is
# added to the pipe from the bottom, through prescribed velocities at the bottom boundary.
# The resulting topography changes are compared to prescribed values, accounting for volume
# compression caused by equilibration.
# The volume and topographic changes are consistent with the density compression ratio
# of the incoming material. Although an error of approximately 0.088% is observed
# at global refinement 0, it converges to nearly zero with increasing global refinement.
# Analytical solution: every 1e5 yr, the topo increase 988.230952 m
