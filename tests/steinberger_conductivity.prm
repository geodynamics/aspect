# This is a test for the pressure- and temperature-dependent
# thermal conductivity. It uses a linearly increasing temperature
# in x-direction and a linearly increasing pressure in y
# direction. The results can be compared with Stackhouse et al.,
# 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2015.06.050).
