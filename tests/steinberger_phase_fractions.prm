# This is a copy of Steinberger compressible test,
# but it uses a pyrolite material property table instead
# of the test data, so that reasonable seismic velocities are
# computed. The property table also contains volume fractions of the
# stable phases in the rock, which can be output using
# the "named additional outputs" in the list of named outputs for
# the Visualization postprocessor.
# The material property table was created from raw PerpleX-vertex output
# using the python script
# contrib/python/create_aspect_readable_perplex_table_with_phase_volumes.py

# The PerpleX calculations were run with the
# Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni
# (2011; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04890.x) dataset.

# The pyrolite composition is a six-component version of the composition in
# McDonough and Sun (1995; https://doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(94)00140-4):
# 0.36 wt% Na2O, 37.8 wt% MgO, 4.45 wt% Al2O3, 45.0 wt% SiO2, 3.55 wt% CaO, 8.05 wt% FeO
