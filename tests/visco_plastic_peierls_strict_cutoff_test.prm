# A test for the exact Peierls creep flow law
# with the visco_plastic material model.
# Following the general Peierls creep flow law of Idrissi
# et al. 2016 and assuming a strain rate of 1e-15 s^-1. The stress
# from the Peierls rheology is limited by the cutoff stress
# of 1000 Pa, so a viscosity of 5e17 Pa*s is computed instead
# from:
#     1000 / 1e-15 / 2.0 = 5e17
