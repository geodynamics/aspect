# A simple setup for convection in a 3d ellipsoidal chunk. See the
# manual for more information.

############### Global parameters
# We use a 3d setup. Since we are only interested
# the shape of the grid, we set the end time
# equal to the start time to force a single time
# step before the program terminates.

############### Parameters describing the model
# We create a coordinate-parallel ellipsoidal chunk with
# a large eccentricity (0.5).
# The coordinate-parallel implementation takes two opposite
# corners of the chunk as input.
