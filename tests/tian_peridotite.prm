# This model generates a representation of a phase diagram for the equilibrium
# wt% water that can be stored in an upper mantle peridotite (PUM) as shown in
# Figure 11 of  Tian et. al., 2019. This model reproduces that phase diagram
# (very low res by default), with an important caveat being that the pressure axis
# is inverted relative to the ASPECT output. A surface pressure of 600 MPa is imposed
# to reproduce the pressure axis,and a lateral temperature gradient is imposed to
# reproduce the temperature axis.
