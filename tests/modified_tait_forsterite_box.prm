# The following properties are for forsterite.

# Note that the heat capacity function had to be converted

# The Einstein temperature is calculated empirically from the
# expression in Holland and Powell
# (Einstein temperature  = 10636 / (S/n + 6.44)), where
# S is the standard state molar entropy and n is the number of atoms
# per formula unit.
