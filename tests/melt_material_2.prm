# A testcase that demonstrates melt transport with a compactible matrix,
# but incompressible matrix and fluid. It solves the equation on a box
# with zero velocity boundary conditions at the bottom boundary,
# tangential velocities at the sides and an open boundary at the top.
#
# We then choose a Darcy coefficient (= permeability divided by fluid
# viscosity) of 0.5+y^2/2 and otherwise constant material parameters
# so that the gradient of the fluid pressure vanishes. The velocity
# should then be y^2/2, the compaction pressure -y and the fluid
# pressure should be constant.
#
# We compute these material properties in a new material model, which
# is implemented in the .cc file.
