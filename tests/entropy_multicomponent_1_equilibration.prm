# This is a test case for the multi-component entropy averaging method
# It tests the equilibration of 70% forsterite (starting with entropy = 2700 J/K/kg) 
# and 30% enstatite (starting with entropy = 600 J/K/kg) at 0 pa pressure.
# After the equilibration, the total bulk entropy is conserved, so it should be 2100 J/K/kg), 
# and the two components have the same temperature. 
# Our analytical solution is the equilibrated temperature calculated by the thermodynamic code BurnMan,
# which equals 1117.411360150445 K.
