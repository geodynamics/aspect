# This parameter file is a copy of simple_shear.prm but with the added postprocessor
# "mobility statistics" following Lourenco et al., 2020.
# Mobility = surface rms velocity / whole domain rms velocity.
# This result of ~1.73205 in this test is very close to the analytical
# solution of sqrt(3).
#
# This parameter file reproduces an analytical benchmark for the evolution
# of finite strain in a model of simple shear as described (for a specific
# application) in McKenzie & Jackson (1983): "The relationship between
# strain rates, crustal thickening, paleomagnetism, finite strain and
# fault movements within a deforming zone." They show that the analytical
# solution for the deformation gradient tensor F in simple shear deformation is:
#
# F_xx = 1.0
# F_xy = u_x,y * t
# F_yx = 0
# F_yy = 1.0,
#
# where u is the velocity, t is time, and a comma represents a derivative
# in that particular direction.
# Because u_x,y = 2.0 / 1.0 is constant in the whole domain (and over time) we expect
# a constant F at any given time, and in particular:
# F_xy (t=1.0) = 2.0
#
# This parameter file tracks the finite strain in two ways, once by using
# compositional fields as illustrated in the finite strain cookbook, and
# once by using a particle that sits and remains in the center of the domain.
# The results should be the same.
#
# Numerical results for particle tracking and compositional fields
# show equally excellent agreement.
