# As test 8, this file also tests whether the heat added to the model can be correctly converted
# to internal energy, following the relation: Delta U = T * Delta S - P * Delta V, P = 0
# There is a constant heating from radiogenic heating, distributed uniformly throughout the model.
# The error converges to zero as the time step length is reduced.
