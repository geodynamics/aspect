Additional information: 
    The field composition 1 (advection_particle) is marked as advected by
    particles, but no particle property exists that is mapped to this
    field. The active particle properties in your model are the following:
    velocity
    function
    initial advection_field
    initial advection_particle
    initial advection_particle2
    p
    T
    The property you selected is 'pT path'. Make sure that any particle
    property you want to map to a field exists in your model (by adding it
    to the 'List of particle properties' in the parameter file) and that
    it is mapped to the correct field.
