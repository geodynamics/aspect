# MPI: 4

# Test case that showed two problems:
#
# 1. Parallel mesh smoothing would interfere with minimum refinement function
# leading to missing refinement when run with few cells per processor.
# 2. This leads to a crash with periodic constraints because of a hanging node.
#
# File shows the problem with 7 or more MPI ranks.
