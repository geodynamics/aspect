# This test checks the accuracy of the coordinate transformation
# for the ellipsoidal chunk geometry model. Because the used
# manifold includes an approximation for the conversion between
# spherical and ellipsoidal coordinates the conversion is inaccurate
# very close to the center of the domain. This test documents this
# inaccuracy and shows that it is negligible for points at the
# core-mantle boundary (5e-11 relative to center distance) and even for points
# at the inner-core-boundary (1e-7).
