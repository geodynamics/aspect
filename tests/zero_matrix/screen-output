Exception 'ExcMessage ("The " + field_name + " equation can not be solved, because the matrix is zero, " "but the right-hand side is nonzero.")' on rank 0 on processing: 

An error occurred in file <solver.cc> in function
(line in output replaced by default.sh script)
The violated condition was: 
    system_matrix.block(block_idx, block_idx).linfty_norm() > std::numeric_limits<double>::min()
Additional information: 
    The temperature equation can not be solved, because the matrix is zero, but the right-hand side is nonzero.

Aborting!
