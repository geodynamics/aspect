TimerOutput objects finalize timed values printed to the
screen by communicating over MPI in their destructors.
Since an exception is currently uncaught, this
synchronization (and subsequent output) will be skipped
to avoid a possible deadlock.


Exception 'ExcMessage ("The " + field_name + " equation can not be solved, because the matrix is zero, " "but the right-hand side is nonzero.")' on rank 0 on processing: 

An error occurred in file <solver.cc> in function
(line in output replaced by default.sh script)
The violated condition was: 
    system_matrix.block(block_idx, block_idx).linfty_norm() > std::numeric_limits<double>::min()
Additional information: 
    The temperature equation can not be solved, because the matrix is
    zero, but the right-hand side is nonzero.
