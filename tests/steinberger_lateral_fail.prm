# EXPECT FAILURE

# This is a copy of the simple compressible test.
# However it uses the Steinberger material model, which
# reads in lookup tables. The testdata used in this test
# was prepared with the same equations as in the simple
# compressible material model. However, the lookup table is much too large for
# lateral averaging for the implementation currently, so an error should be
# produced under the current conditions.
