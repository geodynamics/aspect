# This model tests the projected density approximation within 
# The multicomponent compressible material model.
# The model is 1x1 m on 2x2 element grid where we apply a surface pressure equal 
# to 50 GPa with gravity disabled. This creates uniform pressure and density fields,
# This surface pressure and free-slip on all sides does not allow material to flow 
# into or out of the model, while allowing density to accommodate the increased pressure.
# 
# The density within multicomponent compressible is determined using the following parameters:

# reference_thermal_expansivities              = 2e-5
# reference_isothermal_compressibilities       = 4e-12
# temperature                                  = 1600
# reference_temperatures                       = 1600
# isothermal_bulk_modulus_pressure_derivatives = 4
# reference_densities                          = 3300
# pressure                                     = 5e10
# These values are used in the following expression (Python) for the density:
#
# import numpy as np 
# ak = reference_thermal_expansivities/reference_isothermal_compressibilities
# f  = (1. + (pressure - ak*(temperature - reference_temperatures)) *
#                    isothermal_bulk_modulus_pressure_derivatives   *
#                          reference_isothermal_compressibilities)
# densities = reference_densities*np.pow(f, 1./isothermal_bulk_modulus_pressure_derivatives)
# print(densities)

# The resulting spatially-uniform density is 3822.3642114512877.
