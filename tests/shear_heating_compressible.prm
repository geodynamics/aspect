# This is a test for the correct behaviour of 
# the shear heating in the compressible case.
# The velocity is prescribed using the prescribed 
# Stokes solution plugin so that the strain rate is 
# [0 0.5 0.5 2./3.], which means that we can calculate
# the solution for the shear heating (2 eta eps:eps),
# which should be 2.111111.
