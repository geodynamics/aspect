# This is a test for the pressure- and temperature-dependent
# thermal conductivity. It uses a linearly increasing temperature
# in x-direction and a linearly increasing pressure in y
# direction. It has 4 conductivity layers, corresponding to
# forsterite, wadsleyite, ringwoodite and bridgmanite +
# ferropericlase. The results can be compared with Tosi et al.,
# 2013 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2013.02.004), Figure 2.
