# Adiabatic downwelling along a pipe. Initially the material is made of 100% component A 
# (In this case, Forsterite with no phase change)
# The inflow material has increasing percentage of component B 
# (Component B is also Forsterite, but it includes the Fo -> Wad phase transition). 
# The temperature profile changes gradually from the initial adiabat to a new adiabat, 
# the transition starts from the top, and moves to the bottom.
