# This test is a modified version of
# hill_diffusion.prm.
# It is designed to test tangential velocity
# boundary conditions in simulations where the mesh is
# deformed by hillslope diffusion.

# The simulation starts as a box of 200 km width and 50 km height,
# with an initial sinusoidal topography on the top boundary.
# A parabolic shear velocity boundary condition is applied at the
# bottom boundary. The side and top boundaries are given tangential
# velocity boundary conditions.
# Gravity is set to zero. The temperature is constant
# throughout the domain.

# The mesh is deformed by prescribing a mesh velocity at the top
# boundary that simulates hillslope diffusion, keeping the
# overall area of the domain fixed.
# The meshes at the left and right boundaries are allowed
# to deform along their length.
