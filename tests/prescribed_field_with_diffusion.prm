# A testcase that demonstrates that interpolating material model
# outputs into compositional fields and diffusing them works.
#
# The property copied into the compositional field 'prescribed field',
# is a Gaussian with an amplitude of 1, namely exp(-0.5*x*x).
# We choose the diffusion length scale in a way that its amplitude
# should be reduced to 0.95 when the diffusion equation is solved.
#
# The test also contains another compositional field that does
# not use this method, so it should remain zero everywhere
# (which is what the initial condition is).
