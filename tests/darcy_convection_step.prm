# This is a test for limiting the time step when advecting
# a field with the 'darcy field' method without setting
# Include melt transport = true. With the 'darcy field'
# advection method, the field is advected using the Darcy
# velocity, which is expressed as:
#
# u_f = u_s - K_D / phi * (rho_s * g - rho_f * g)
# u_f = fluid velocity # m/yr
# u_s = solid velocity # m/yr
# K_D = Darcy Coefficient # m3 s / kg
# k = permeability # m2 / s
# eta_f = fluid viscosity # Pa s
# phi = porosity
# rho_f = fluid density # kg/m3
# rhos_s = solid density # kg/m3
# g = gravity # m/s2
#
# Additionally, K_D and k can be expanded into:
# K_D = k / eta_f
# k = k_0 * phi**3 * (1 - phi)**2
#
# Where k_0 is the reference permeability. The test is a 10 km x 10 km 2D
# box with a uniform porosity of 0.02 (2%) everywhere. The fluid has a
# density of 1000 kg/m3, and a viscosity of 10 Pa s, and the solid has a
# density of 3000 kg/m3 with an x velocity of 0.001 m/yr and a y velocity of
# 0.75 m/yr. The reference pemeability is 1e-6, and gravity is set to -10.
# This results in a fluid velocity of ~24.9958 m/yr in the y direction, and
# 0.001 m/yr in the x direction The mesh is 2.5 km x 2.5 km, and with CFL = 1,
# this means that the first time step should be 2500 m / 24.9958 m/yr = 100.017 yr.
# This also serves as a test for the 'darcy velocity' postprocessor, by
# confirming that the darcy velocity is 24.9958 m/yr in the y direction, and
# 0.001 m/yr in the x direction.
