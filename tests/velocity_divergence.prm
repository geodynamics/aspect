# This is a test investigating if the divergence
# of the velocity is really zero, as it should be
# in cases where no melt is present. The material model
# implements a reaction term for the porosity
# compositional field that equals the velocity divergence
# in the way it would be used in models with melt transport,
# but in this model melt migration is not used.
#
# The divergence is zero if the velocity is prescribed at
# all of the boundaries, but not with a mix of free slip and
# prescribed velocity boundary conditions.
