# This is a benchmark case for the multi-component entropy averaging method
# It tests the equilibration of 70% forsterite (starting with entropy = 2700 J/K/kg)
# and 30% enstatite (starting with entropy = 700 J/K/kg) at increasing pressure conditions.
# This is like moving material from the surface to increasing depth.
# At the last time step (pressure = 4e10) the expected temperature (calculated by BurnMan)
# should be 1320.6975594320584; entropy should be 2100; density should be 3897.462703346402
