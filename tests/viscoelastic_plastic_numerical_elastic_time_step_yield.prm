# This test checks viscoelastic stress buildup with a
# constant strain rate, an elastic time step equal
# to the numerical time step and a yield stress of 1 MPa. 
# The fixed elastic time step used during the first time 
# step is equal to the numerical time step. Viscoelastic 
# stresses (sigma_xx, sigma_yy, sigma_xy) are tracked with 
# compositional fields. The yield stress of 1 MPa should 
# prevent elastic stresses from accumulating above this
# value. The parameter file is derived from the 2D 
# viscoelastic_stress_build-up benchmark with modifications 
# to the resolution, end time, material properties and 
# postprocessors.
