# A testcase for the "shear stress" visualization postprocessor
# when elasticity is enabled. The rheology is viscoelastic,
# but otherwise the test is identical to visualization_shear_stress.prm.
# In the first timestep, the elastic initial conditions
# impose zero differential stress. A very high shear modulus relative
# to the viscosity ensures that the differential stress quickly approaches
# the value from the original viscous test.
#
# The test solves the equations on a box with Dirichlet boundary
# conditions equal to (z,0), which then is also the velocity everywhere.
# This yields a constant strain rate [[0,1/2],[1/2,0]].
#
# the stress is then simply this tensor times -2*eta plus the pressure and we set
# eta=42 below. compared to the visualization_shear_stress test, the test
# also includes a nonzero gravity so that we get a nonconstant pressure
#
# the second invariant of the deviatoric stress will be 42.
