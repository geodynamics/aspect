# A testcase that demonstrates that interpolating material model
# outputs into compositional fields works.
#
# The density is chosen as rho = 1 + 0.1*sin(2*pi*x)*sin(2*pi*y)
# and is copied into the compositional field 'prescribed field',
# so the minimum and maximum composition should be 0.9 at 1.1,
# respectively.
# The test also contains another compositional field that does
# not use this method, so it should remain zero everywhere
# (which is what the initial condition is).
