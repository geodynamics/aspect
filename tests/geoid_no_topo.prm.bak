# A simple pure math setup to compute geoid in single degree 2 order 0 perturbation density field.
# The perturbation is added to a constant density, i.e., degree 0 order 0 component.
# The analytic solution of the density integral contribution of this case should be -0.53059320038
# for (2,0) component and 14.1570019498 for degree 0 order 0.
# The contribution from dynamic topography is not included.
