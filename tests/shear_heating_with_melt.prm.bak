# This is a test for the heating model plugins related to
# melt migration, in particular shear heating with melt.
# In this 1D model, material is upwelling with a high temperature
# from the bottom boundary and melting adiabatically. This
# leads to dissipation heating due to the relative movement of
# melt and solid. As these terms scale with 1/porosity, this
# can lead to instabilities. However, this can be avoided by
# choosing a resolution that is high enough and choosing the
# Darcy coefficient variation threshold to be not too small
# (here, the default value is sufficient).

# The test is based on the model of 1D upwelling melting in a
# plume with melt-related heating in the Supplementary material
# of Dannberg & Heister, 2016.
# To better compare the results with Dannberg & Heister, 2016,
# the bottom boundary temperature can be changed to 2000 K
# (this is just not feasible in the test, as it would take too
# many time time steps until the onset of melting).
