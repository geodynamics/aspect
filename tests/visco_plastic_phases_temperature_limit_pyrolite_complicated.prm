# This test uses a similar setup as visco_plastic.prm and includes the phase transitions
# of a complicated set. This is not a realistic case but is only a test for the implementation.
# Here I am showing the variations of material properties using the "specific heat" field.
# specifically, the usage of the "Phase transition temperature lower limits" and
# the "Phase transition temperature upper limits" are demonstrated in this test case.
# For other compositions, see also:
