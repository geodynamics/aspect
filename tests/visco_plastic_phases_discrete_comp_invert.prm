# This prm file is used to generate a phase diagram.
# and test the implementation of discrete phase functions
# in the visco-plastic material model. Specifically, this test
# inverts the indicator for phase transition lookup from 0 to 1
# and checks the implementation for multiple compositions.
# In the outputs, the material statistics are checked for
# correct viscosity values.
