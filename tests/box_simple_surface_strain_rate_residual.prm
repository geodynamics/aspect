##### simple test to check the boundary strain rate residual statistics and
##### visualization postprocessor. The input data has zero strain rate so
##### to check that the posprocessor is working : the output `strain rate`
##### and `boundary strain rate residual` are equal in magnitude and opposite
##### in signs.
