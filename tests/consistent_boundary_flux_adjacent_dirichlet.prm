# This test is based on boundary_heat_flux and checks that the consistent
# boundary flux method in the heatflux statistics postprocessor computes
# the correct boundary fluxes for models with Dirichlet temperature
# boundary conditions on two adjacent faces of the same cell that belong
# to different boundaries.
