# This tests an implementation of anisotropic viscosity terms in the Stokes
# equation. In this test we create new assembler
# classes in anisotropic_viscosity.cc that extend the standard assemblers
# with a fourth order viscosity tensor. The chosen material model 'anisotropic'
# then replaces the standard assemblers with the custom ones during the call
# to the set_assemblers signal, and during every call to evaluate()
# fills the AdditionalMaterialOutputs object of type AnisotropicViscosity with
# the chosen viscosity tensor that is selected in this input file.
# This way the solved equations are changed without modifying the main code
# base.
