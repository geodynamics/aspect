# A testcase that demonstrates that interpolating material model
# outputs into the temperature field works.
#
# The material model prescribes the temperature to be exactly the
# pressure of the model
# and is copied into the temperature field,
# so the minimum and maximum temperature should be 0.0 and 1.0,
# respectively.
