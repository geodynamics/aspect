# This test prescribes a velocity field in x direction of the form:
# vx = 0.1 + t, where t is time. Therefore the position of
# the single particle in this test follows:
# x(t) = 0.5*t^2 + 0.1 * t, which results to:
# x(1) = 0.6, for a particle starting at x(0)=0
# Because the position is a polynomial of second order, and we use
# a second-order time-accurate integrator (rk2), the particle arrives
# at the exact end position.
