# In ASPECT 1.2, we managed to get the adiabatic initial conditions
# wrong in the rare case of no prescribed boundary temperature and a 
# prescribed bottom thermal boundary layer age. This case makes no sense,
# but it might occur by accident. The expected result is no boundary layer,
# however previously we computed a boundary layer against the adiabatic
# surface temperature. This test verifies the solution of this bug.
