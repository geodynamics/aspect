# A testcase that demonstrates compressibility. It solves the
# equations on a box with Dirichlet boundary conditions equal to
# (0,1) at the bottom boundary, a tangential velocity at the sides
# and a free boundary at the top.
#
# We then choose a density rho=1+p and a compressibility that leads
# to an exponential density profile rho=e^z, i.e.
# compressibility=1/rho drho/dp=1/(1+p). The mass flux (product of density
# and velocity) into the box and out of the box should be the same.
#
# We can only tell that the correct mass flux is computed in a
# postprocessor, which we implement in the .cc file.
#
#
# The correct solution has an exponentially increasing pressure and
# density (top to bottom) where p(z)=e^(1-z)-1  (depth=1-z) and
# rho(z)=e^(1-z). To conserve mass, this then requires a velocity
# in z-direction equal to
#    v(z) = e^(-(1-z))
# However, this is the product of the equation
#    div(rho u) = 0
# which we instead solve in each iteration as
#    div u = -1/rho drho/dp u^* . g
# where u^* is a linearization point. In the first iteration, we start
# with u^*=0, so we solve
#    div u = 0
# and the velocity field is of course completely wrong (it does not
# accelerate towards the top as expected but is in fact constant).
#
# This testcase therefore verifies that we compute this wrong solution
# in the first iteration. We use the Stokes only/max_nonlinear_iterations=1
# option for the solver scheme.
