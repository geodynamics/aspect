# A test, whether we apply the right pressure compatibility
# correction in the case of prescribed boundary conditions.
# This test is essentially similar to the platelike-boundary
# cookbook but uses a strongly compressible material model.
# Previously we did not correct the pressure RHS in this setup,
# which prevented it from converging.
