# This is a benchmark case that tests the operator split
# solver scheme, which can use a different time step to
# compute reactions between compositional fields than
# the time step used for advection.
# In this test case, there is no advection, and we start
# from a composition (and temperature) that is 1 everywhere
# in the domain and then decays over time, following the
# equations for exponential decay.

# We use a plugin that implements the reactions for exponential
# decay.

# As we split the time-stepping of advection and reactions,
# there are now two different time steps in the model:
# We control the advection time step using the 'Maximum time step'
# parameter (as this benchmark has no driving force, and hence very
# low velocities, we can not use the CFL number), and the reaction
# time step is controlled internally through the ODE solver scheme.
# Instead of changing the step for the ODE solver, we can make the
# solution more accurate by modifying the Reaction solver relative
# tolerance.
