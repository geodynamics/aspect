# a case where we have a large static pressure, 1e6 times larger than the

# note that to get the same number of iterations as for the
# sol_cx_4_normalized_pressure testcase, we have to set the linear solver
# tolerance to something smaller, because the right hand side vector is
# much larger when using a large background density. then, however, using
# the exact same number of iterations, we get the exact same error, as
# claimed in the appendix of the first ASPECT paper
