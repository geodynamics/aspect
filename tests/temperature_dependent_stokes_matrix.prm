# We used to have the problem that if the viscosity
# depended on the temperature, we would still not want
# to re-compute the Stokes matrix. This was a clear bug.
# This test verifies that this is now fixed by creating
# a temperature-dependent viscosity and using it to run
# a model that has several time steps. The velocities we
# get need to be the ones that come from the re-computed
# Stokes matrix, and they have different RMS values.
