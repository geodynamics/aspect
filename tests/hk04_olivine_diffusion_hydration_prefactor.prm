# A test case that checks the water fugacity viscous prefactor
# multiplication scheme in combination with the visco plastic material model.
# Following the flow law for wet olivine diffusion creep from
# Hirth & Kohlstaedt 2004 (10.1029/138GM06), the exact
# viscosity is calculated in python through:
# import numpy as np
# m = 3
# d = 1e-3 m
# E = 375e3 J/mol
# V = 15e-6 m^3/mol
# R = 8.3144621
# P = 10e9 Pa
# r = 0.7
# T = 1673 K
# A_diff = 2.5e7 / 1e6 / 1e6**m / 1e6**r 1/Pa^2/m^3/s
#
# A_H2O = 26 / 1e6**r 1/Pa
# activation_energy_H2O = 40e3 J/mol
# activation_volume_H2O = 10e-6 m^3/mol
#
# M_H2O = 18.01528
# M_olivine = 147.0027
#
# weight_fraction_h2o = 0.01
# weight_fraction_olivine = 1 - weight_fraction_h2o
# COH = (wt_fraction_h2o/M_H2O) / (weight_fraction_olivine/M_olivine) * 1e6
#
# fH2O = COH / A_H2O * np.exp((activation_energy_H2O + P*activation_volume_H2O)/(R * T))
# viscosity_analytic = 0.5 * A_diff**(-1) * d**(m) * np.exp((E + P*V) / R / T) * fH2O**(-r)
#
# In the background composition, r=0.7 and the viscosity should be equal to 2.766e19.
#
# In the solid_2 composition, r=0.0 and the viscosity should be equal to 4.924e23.
# Combined, this should result in an average model viscosity of 2.462e23.
# The material model should return this viscosity.
