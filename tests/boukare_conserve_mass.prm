# This setup checks that mass is conserved when reactions occur.
# The model starts with a Gaussian porosity distributon that
# solidifies over time, decreasing the density in the model.
# According to this change in mass, material flows out of the box
# at the top. At refinement 5, the outflow should be about
# 2336 kg/yr in the first time step and 819 kg/yr in the second
# time step (they should equal the product of the change in mass
# of the porosity field and the density difference between melt
# and solid of 72.3 kg/m^3, divided by the time step size).
