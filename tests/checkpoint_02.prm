# test checkpoint/resume.

# Like checkpoint_01, but we resume from the first of two snapshots. That way
# we can actually compare if the checkpoint data of the second checkpoint is
# identical.

# Note: this requires a patch to Trilinos' ML (at least version 12.2.1 and
# older) because the preconditioner is not deterministic.
