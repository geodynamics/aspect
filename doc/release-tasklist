This release adds a significant number of new features, including:
   - support for active and passive "compositional" fields (courtesy of

   - more flexibility to output only some variables, drastically reducing
     the amount of data written

     of Rene Gassmoeller)
   - support for passive tracer particles
   - provision of an "introspection" module as part of the source code
     to make it easier and less error-prone to write extension code
In addition, the manual has been significantly expanded, with many new
cookbooks, and we have fixed a number of bugs. A list of changes is
available here:
