Announcement for 1.3 (May 18, 2015)
-----------------------------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 1.3. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible, and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                   https://aspect.dealii.org/

and the release is available from

        https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/releases/tag/v1.3

This release includes the following changes:
- New: Averaging of material properties between the quadrature points of a
  cell. This greatly increases the stability of solutions in simulations with
  spatially varying coefficients, and also greatly accelerates the solution,
  at times up to a factor of ten.
- Corrections to the entropy stabilization scheme for compositional fields.
- Fixed and extended: Removal of rigid body translations and rotations when
  the simulation has a nullspace.
- New: VTU visualization output can now be grouped into an arbitrary number of
  files per time step.
- Various fixes to the nonlinear solver residual computation.
- New visualization postprocessors that can output the shear stress and full
  stress tensors.
- Fixes to the latent heat formulation.
- New 'ascii data' plugins for boundary and initial conditions.
- New mass flux statistics postprocessor.
- Many other fixes and small improvements.

A complete list of changes can be found at
  https://aspect.dealii.org/doc/doxygen/changes_between_1_82_and_1_83.html
and the release is also available from
  https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/releases/tag/v1.3

Announcement for 1.2 (January 25rd, 2015)
-----------------------------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 1.2. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                   http://aspect.dealii.org/

This release includes the following changes:
- methods to have truly concentric shells without distorted cells
- linear solver improvements which give up to 2x speedup in some cases
- boundary names like "top" instead of numbers are now supported in input files
- new example: free surface computation with a crust as a stagnant lid
- new benchmarks: Davies et al. and Burstedde et al.
- new initial condition: S40RTS perturbation based on shear wave data
- fixes to minimum/maximum refinement plugins
- better error messages when linear solvers fail
- many other fixes and small improvements (direct solver, file output,
  checkpointing, etc.)

Announcement for 1.1 (June 1st, 2014)
---------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 1.1. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such

- free surface computations
- optional direct solver support
- new material models (multi-component, simple compressible, ...)
- finer mesh refinement control using plugins
- updates to dynamic topography postprocessors

- a lot of new documentation
- new examples (2d/3d shells, GPlates, ...)
- option to remove rotational/translational modes

Announcement for 0.3:
---------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 0.3. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                   http://aspect.dealii.org/

This is primarily a bug fix release. It fixes a bug in the computation of adiabatic initial temperature conditions when specifying inner or outer boundary layers (thanks to Juliane Dannberg for finding and fixing it). The doxygen-generated documentation now also automatically cross-links to deal.II classes wherever they are referenced in ASPECT.

Announcement for 0.2:
---------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 0.2. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                    http://aspect.dealii.org/

This release adds a significant number of new features, including:
   - support for active and passive "compositional" fields (courtesy of
     Juliane Dannberg)
   - more flexibility to output only some variables, drastically reducing
     the amount of data written
   - support for user-defined mesh refinement criteria
   - support for GPlates-generated velocity boundary conditions (courtesy
     of Rene Gassmoeller)
   - support for passive tracer particles
   - provision of an "introspection" module as part of the source code
     to make it easier and less error-prone to write extension code
In addition, the manual has been significantly expanded, with many new
cookbooks, and we have fixed a number of bugs. A list of changes is
available here:
