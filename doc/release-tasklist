Announcement for 2.1.0 (April 29, 2019)
-----------------------------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 2.1.0. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible, and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                   https://aspect.geodynamics.org/

and the release is available from

        https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/aspect/

and

        https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/releases/tag/v2.1.0

This release includes the following significant changes:
- New: ASPECT has a new plugin system that allows it to prescribe a fixed
  heat flux (instead of prescribing the temperature) at the model boundaries.
- New: Compositional fields can optionally be advected with the melt velocity.
- New: There is now a visualization postprocessor that outputs the compaction
  length, the characteristic length scale of melt transport.
- New: ASPECT can optionally use the Geodynamic World Builder
  (https://github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder/) to create complex
  initial conditions for temperature and composition.
- New: ASPECT can now read in a depth-dependent vs to density conversion file, which
  can be used with the included tomography model plugins.
- New: ASPECT can now read in a depth-dependent initial temperature from file.
- New: The 'ascii data' and 'function' boundary velocity plugins now allow
  velocities to be specified along spherical (up, east, north) unit vectors.
- New: Added a visualization plugin that directly outputs the strain rate tensor.
- New: ASPECT can now call PerpleX to calculate material properties, phase
  amounts and compositions on-the-fly. This model is provided as a
  proof-of-concept; more efficient procedures are required for production runs.
- New: ASPECT now outputs a dynamically generated URL based on used features to
  ask people to cite appropriate papers.
- New: ASPECT has two visualization postprocessors which calculate and output
  the grain lag angle and the infinite strain axis (ISA) rotation timescale,
  respectively. These two quantities can be used to calculate the grain
  orientation lag parameter of Kaminski and Ribe (G3, 2002).
- Improved: The artificial diffusion term that is added in the entropy
  viscosity method to the temperature and composition equations is now computed
  as the maximum of the physical diffusion and entropy viscosity instead of the
  sum. This reduces numerical diffusion for the temperature field.
- New: Compositional fields can now be prescribed to a value that is computed
  in the material model as an additional output at every time step.
- Changed: The heat flux through boundary cells is now computed using the
  consistent boundary flux method as described in Gresho, et al. (1987), which
  is much more accurate than the previously used method.
- New: ASPECT can now calculate gravity anomalies in addition to the geoid.
- New: ASPECT now outputs a file named original.prm in the output directory
  with the exact content of the parameter it got started with.
- New: Added basic support for a volume-of-fluid interface tracking advection
  method in 2D incompressible box models. The VoF method is an efficient method
  to track a distinct compositional field without artificial diffusion.
- New: There is now an option to output visualization data as higher order
  polynomials. This is an improvement in accuracy and requires less disk space
  than the 'Interpolate output' option that was available before. However the
  new output can only be read by ParaView version 5.5 and newer and is
  therefore disabled by default.
- New: Several new benchmark cases were added.
- Many other fixes and smaller improvements.

Announcement for 2.0.1 (June 21, 2018)
-----------------------------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 2.0.1. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible, and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                   https://aspect.geodynamics.org/

and the release is available from

        https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/releases/tag/v2.0.1

This release is a bugfix release for 2.0.0 and includes the following fixes:
- Fixed: The 'compositional heating' heating plugin had a parameter
  'Use compositional field for heat production averaging' that was used
  inconsistently with its description. Its first entry did not correspond
  to the background field, but to the first compositional field, and the
  last value was ignored. This is fixed now, the first entry is used for
  the background field, and all following values determine whether to include
  the corresponding compositional fields.
- Fixed: The 'depth dependent' material model did not properly initialize
  the material model it uses as a base model. This caused crashes if the
  base model requires an initialization (such as the 'steinberger' material
  model). This is fixed now by properly initializing the base model.
- Fixed: The advection assembler for DG elements was not thread-safe,
  which led to wrong results or crashes if a discontinuous temperature
  or composition discretization was combined with multithreading.
- Disabled: The particle functionality was not tested when combined with a
  free surface boundary, and this combination is currently not supported. This
  limitation is now made clear by failing for such setups with a descriptive
  error message.

  at times up to a factor of ten.
- Corrections to the entropy stabilization scheme for compositional fields.
- Fixed and extended: Removal of rigid body translations and rotations when
  the simulation has a nullspace.
- New: VTU visualization output can now be grouped into an arbitrary number of
  files per time step.
- Various fixes to the nonlinear solver residual computation.
- New visualization postprocessors that can output the shear stress and full
  stress tensors.
- Fixes to the latent heat formulation.
- New 'ascii data' plugins for boundary and initial conditions.
- New mass flux statistics postprocessor.
- Many other fixes and small improvements.

Announcement for 1.2 (January 25rd, 2015)
-----------------------------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 1.2. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                   http://aspect.dealii.org/

This release includes the following changes:
- methods to have truly concentric shells without distorted cells
- linear solver improvements which give up to 2x speedup in some cases
- boundary names like "top" instead of numbers are now supported in input files
- new example: free surface computation with a crust as a stagnant lid
- new benchmarks: Davies et al. and Burstedde et al.
- new initial condition: S40RTS perturbation based on shear wave data
- fixes to minimum/maximum refinement plugins
- better error messages when linear solvers fail
- many other fixes and small improvements (direct solver, file output,
  checkpointing, etc.)

This release combines the incredible number of changes made during the
ASPECT hackathon in May 2014, as well as other changes made since the
last release. In particular, it includes the following changes:
- fixes to Stokes solver tolerance (users might need to change settings!)
- free surface computations
- optional direct solver support
- new material models (multi-component, simple compressible, ...)
- finer mesh refinement control using plugins
- updates to dynamic topography postprocessors
- updates to gplates boundary conditions
- compositional fields can now react with each other
- new cookbooks: reaction between fields, free surfaces
- improved PETSc support
- boundary conditions can now be time dependent 
- support for radiogenic heating models

Announcement for 0.3:
---------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 0.3. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                   http://aspect.dealii.org/

This is primarily a bug fix release. It fixes a bug in the computation of adiabatic initial temperature conditions when specifying inner or outer boundary layers (thanks to Juliane Dannberg for finding and fixing it). The doxygen-generated documentation now also automatically cross-links to deal.II classes wherever they are referenced in ASPECT.

Announcement for 0.2:
---------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ASPECT 0.2. ASPECT is the Advanced
Solver for Problems in Earth ConvecTion. It uses modern numerical methods such
as adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid, and a modular software design to
provide a fast, flexible and extensible mantle convection solver. ASPECT is
available from

                    http://aspect.dealii.org/

This release adds a significant number of new features, including:
   - support for active and passive "compositional" fields (courtesy of
     Juliane Dannberg)
   - more flexibility to output only some variables, drastically reducing
     the amount of data written
   - support for user-defined mesh refinement criteria
   - support for GPlates-generated velocity boundary conditions (courtesy
     of Rene Gassmoeller)
   - support for passive tracer particles
   - provision of an "introspection" module as part of the source code
     to make it easier and less error-prone to write extension code
In addition, the manual has been significantly expanded, with many new
cookbooks, and we have fixed a number of bugs. A list of changes is
available here:
