abstract = {This release includes the following changes:


New: Choice between different formulations for the governing equations including Boussinesq and anelastic liquid approximation.
New: Melt transport (two-phase flow).
Particles: new generators, ghost exchange, performance improvements, interpolation to fields.
New: Nondimensional material model for incompressible (using the Boussinesq approximation) and compressible computations (with ALA or TALA) for nondimensionalized problems. This can be used for benchmark problems like Blankenbach, King, etc..
New: Optional DG method for temperature/composition.
Adiabatic conditions: rework, now includes a reference density profile
Free surface: overhaul.
New cookbooks: continental extension, finite strain.
New benchmarks: TanGurnis, Blankenbach, King.
New: viscoplastic material model.
Material model interface cleanup.
Assembly performance improvements.
New: memory statistics postprocessor.
New: initial topography plugins.
Many other fixes and small improvements.},

@article{Rose2017a,
abstract = {Mass redistribution in the convecting mantle of a planet causes perturbations in its moment of inertia tensor. Conservation of angular momentum dictates that these perturbations change the direction of the rotation vector of the planet, a process known as true polar wander (TPW). Although the existence of TPW on Earth is firmly established, its rate and magnitude over geologic time scales remain controversial. Here we present scaling analyses and numerical simulations of TPW due to mantle convection over a range of parameter space relevant to planetary interiors. For simple rotating convection, we identify a set of dimensionless parameters that fully characterize true polar wander. We use these parameters to define timescales for the growth of moment of inertia perturbations due to convection and for their relaxation due to true polar wander. These timescales, as well as the relative sizes of convective anomalies, control the rate and magnitude of TPW. This analysis also clarifies the nature of so called "inertial interchange" TPW events, and relates them to a broader class of events that enable large and often rapid TPW. We expect these events to have been more frequent in Earth's past.},

abstract = {Abstract We combine numerical modeling of lithospheric extension with analysis of seismic moment release and earthquake b-value in order to elucidate the mechanism for deep crustal seismicity and seismic swarms in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). We run 2-D numerical simulations of lithospheric deformation calibrated by appropriate rheology and extensional history of the MER to simulate migration of deformation from mid-Miocene border faults to ~30 km wide zone of Pliocene to recent rift floor faults. While currently the highest strain rate is localized in a narrow zone within the rift axis, brittle strain has been accumulated in a wide region of the rift. The magnitude of deviatoric stress shows strong variation with depth. The uppermost crust deforms with maximum stress of 80 MPa, at 8-14 km depth stress sharply decreases to 10 MPa and then increases to a maximum of 160 MPa at ~18 km depth. These two peaks at which the crust deforms with maximum stress of 80 MPa or above correspond to peaks in the seismic moment release. Correspondingly, the drop in stress at 8-14 km correlates to a low in seismic moment release. At this depth range, the crust is weaker and deformation is mainly accommodated in a ductile manner. We therefore see a good correlation between depths at which the crust is strong and elevated seismic deformation, while regions where the crust is weaker deform more aseismically. Overall, the bimodal depth distribution of seismic moment release is best explained by the rheology of the deforming crust.},

abstract = "Two large areas of anomalously low seismic velocities are visible in all tomographic models of the lowermost mantle. Depending on the density structure of these Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), the core-mantle boundary (CMB) will deform upwards or downwards due to isostatic and dynamic topography, the latter being sensitive to the viscosity structure of the lowermost mantle. Heterogeneities in the viscosity structure, although difficult to constrain, might be especially important if the LLSVPs are thermochemical piles with elevated intrinsic viscosity as suggested by mineral physics. Based on numerical models, we identify a short-wavelength (about 80-120 km wide, up to a few km deep) topographic depression that forms around the pile edges if the pile is more viscous than the surrounding mantle. The depression forms when a wedge of thermal boundary layer material becomes compressed against the viscous pile, and is enhanced by relative uplift of the CMB beneath the pile by plumes rising above it. The depth and asymmetry of the depression constrain the magnitude of the viscosity contrast between pile and the surrounding mantle. Furthermore, (periodic) plume initiation and pile collapse at the pile margin systematically modify the characteristic depression, with a maximum in asymmetry and depth at the time of plume initiation. Core-reflected waves or scattered energy may be used to detect this topographic signature of stiff thermochemical piles at the base of the mantle."

Previous studies have used geological, atmospheric, and biogenic {\textquoteleft}geomarkers{\textquoteright} to supplement supercontinent identification. However, there is no formal definition of how much continental material is required to be assembled, or indeed which geomarkers need to be present. Pannotia is a hypothesized landmass that existed in the interval \~{}0.65-0.54 Ga and was comprised of Gondwana, Laurentia, Baltica, and possibly Siberia. Although Pannotia was considerably smaller than Pangaea (and also fleeting in its existence), the presence of geomarkers in the geological record support its identification as a supercontinent. Using 3-D mantle convection models, we simulate the evolution of the mantle in response to the convergence leading to amalgamation of Rodinia and Pangaea. We then compare this supercontinent {\textquoteleft}fingerprint{\textquoteright} to Pannotian activity. For the first time, we show that Pannotian continental convergence could have generated a mantle signature in keeping with that of a simulated supercontinent. As a result, we posit that any formal identification of a supercontinent must take into consideration the thermal evolution of the mantle associated with convergence leading to continental amalgamation, rather than simply the size of the connected continental landmass.},

abstract={Lithospheric tearing at slab edges is common in scenarios where retreating slabs face continental margins. Such tearing is often accommodated via subvertical STEP (Subduction-Transform Edge Propagator) faults that cut across the entire lithosphere and can result in sharp lateral thermal and rheological variations across the juxtaposed lithospheres. This setting favors the occurrence of continental delamination, i.e., the detachment between the crust and the lithospheric mantle. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, we have chosen a well-studied natural example recently imaged with unprecedented seismic resolution: the STEP fault under the central Betic orogen, at the northern edge of the Gibraltar Arc subduction system (westernmost Mediterranean Sea). The Gibraltar Arc subduction is the result of the fast westward roll-back of the Alboran slab and it is in its last evolutionary stage, where the oceanic lithosphere has been fully consumed and the continental lithosphere attached to it collides with the overriding plate. In this study we investigate by means of thermo-mechanical modeling the conditions for, and consequences of, delamination post-dating slab tearing in the central Betics. We consider a setup based on a STEP fault separating the orogenic Betic lithosphere and the adjacent thinned lithosphere of the overriding Alboran domain. Our model analysis indicates that delamination is very sensitive to the initial thermal and rheological conditions, transitioning from a stable to a very unstable and rapidly evolving regime. We find two clearly differentiated regimes according to the time at which the process becomes unstable: fast and slow delamination. Although the final state reached in both the fast and slow regimes is similar, the dynamic surface topography evolution is dramatically different. We suggest that given a weak enough Iberian lower crust the delaminating lithospheric mantle peels off the crust and adopts a geometry consistent with the imaged southward dipping Iberian lithosphere in the central Betics. The lack of spatial correspondence between the highest topography and the thickest crust, as well as the observed pattern of uplift/subsidence are properly reproduced by a model where relatively fast delamination (Reference Model) develops after slab tearing.}

abstract="Deformation in the orogen-foreland system of the southern Central Andes between 33{\textdegree} and 36{\textdegree} S varies in style, locus, and amount of shortening. The controls that determine these spatially variable characteristics have largely remained unknown, yet both the subduction of the oceanic Nazca plate and the strength of the South American plate have been invoked to play a major role. While the parameters governing the subduction processes are similar between 33{\textdegree} and 36{\textdegree} S, the lithospheric strength of the upper plate is spatially variable due to structures inherited from past geodynamic regimes and associated compositional differences in the South American plate. Regional Mesozoic crustal horizontal extension generated a < 40-km-thick crust with a more mafic composition in the lower crust south of 35{\textdegree}S; north of this latitude, however, a more felsic lower crust is inferred from geophysical data. To assess the influence of different structural and compositional heterogeneities on the style of deformation in the southern Central Andes, we developed a suite of geodynamic models of intraplate lithospheric shortening for two E-W transects (33{\textdegree} 40{\textquoteright} S and 36{\textdegree} S) across the Andes. The models are constrained by local geological and geophysical information. Our results demonstrate a decoupled shortening mode between the brittle upper crust and the ductile lower crust in those areas characterized by a mafic lower crust (36{\textdegree} S transect). In contrast, a more felsic lower crust, such as in the 33{\textdegree} 40{\textquoteright} S transect, results in a coupled shortening mode. Furthermore, we find that differences in lithospheric thickness and the asymmetry of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary may promote the formation of a crustal-scale, west-dipping detachment zone that drives the overall deformation and lateral expansion of the orogen. Our study represents the first geodynamic modeling effort in the southern Central Andes aimed at understanding the roles of heterogeneities (crustal composition and thickness) at the scale of the entire lithosphere as well as the geometry of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary with respect to mountain building.",

The last section of this chapter features an overview of the classical concept of deep-mantle plumes from a geodynamic point of view and how recent insights, mostly from seismic tomography, have changed the understanding of plume structures and dynamics over past decades. The long-standing and controversial hypothesis of a mantle plume beneath West Antarctica is summarized and addressed with geodynamic models, which estimate the excess heat flow of a potential plume at the bedrock surface. However, the predicted heat flow is small, while differences in surface heat-flux estimates are large; therefore, the results are not conclusive with regard to the existence of a West Antarctic mantle plume. Finally, it is shown that global mantle flow would cause the tilting of whole-mantle plume conduits beneath West Antarctica such that their base is predicted to be displaced about 20{\textdegree} northward relative to the surface position, closer to the southern margin of the Pacific Large Low-Shear Velocity Province.},

abstract = {Abstract Deep-rooted mantle plumes are thought to originate from the margins of the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) at the base of the mantle. Visible in seismic tomography, the LLSVPs are usually interpreted to be intrinsically dense thermochemical piles in numerical models. Although piles deflect lateral mantle flow upward at their edges, the mechanism for localized plume formation is still not well understood. In this study, we develop numerical models that show plumes rising from the margin of a dense thermochemical pile, temporarily increasing its local thickness until material at the pile top cools and the pile starts to collapse back toward the core-mantle boundary (CMB). This causes dense pile material to spread laterally along the CMB, locally thickening the lower thermal boundary layer on the CMB next to the pile, and initiating a new plume. The resulting plume cycle is reflected in both the thickness and lateral motion of the local pile margin within a few hundred km of the pile edge, while the overall thickness of the pile is not affected. The period of plume generation is mainly controlled by the rate at which slab material is transported to the CMB, and thus depends on the plate velocity and the sinking rate of slabs in the lower mantle. A pile collapse, with plumes forming along the edges of the pile's radially extending corner, may, for example, explain the observed clustering of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) in the southeastern corner of the African LLSVP around 95-155 Ma.},

In this study, we model stress fields due to heterogeneities in the upper mantle beneath the CEUS including a high-velocity feature identified as a lithospheric drip in a recent regional P-wave tomography study. We calculate velocity and stress distributions from numerical models for instantaneous 3-D mantle flow. Our models are driven by the heterogeneous density distribution based on a temperature field converted from the tomography study. The temperature field is utilized in a composite rheology, assumed for the numerical models. We compute several geodynamic quantities with our numerical models: dynamic topography, rate of dynamic topography, gravitational potential energy (GPE), differential stress, and Coulomb stress. We find that the GPE, representative of the density anomalies in the lithosphere, is an important factor for understanding the seismicity of the CEUS. When only the upper mantle heterogeneities are included in a model, differential and Coulomb stress for the observed fault geometries in the CEUS seismic zones acts as a good indicator to predict the seismicity distribution. Our modelling results suggest that the upper mantle heterogeneities and structure below the CEUS have stress concentration effects and are likely to promote earthquake generation at preexisting faults in the region's seismic zones. Our results imply that the mantle flow due to the upper-mantle heterogeneities can cause stress perturbations, which could help explain the intraplate seismicity in this region.}",

Footwall rocks experience large rotation during exhumation, yet important aspects of the kinematics—particularly the relative roles of solid-block rotation and flexure—are not clearly understood. Using a high-resolution numerical model, we explore the exhumation kinematics in the footwall beneath an emergent ODF/OCC. A key feature of the models is that footwall motion is dominated by solid-block rotation, accommodated by the nonplanar, concave-down fault interface. A consequence is that curvature measured along the ODF is representative of a neutral stress configuration, rather than a “bent” one. Instead, it is in the subsequent process of “apparent unbending” that significant flexural stresses are developed in the model footwall. The brittle strain associated with apparent unbending is produced dominantly in extension, beneath the OCC, consistent with earthquake clustering observed in the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.},

abstract = {Orogeny results from crustal thickening at active margins, and much progress has been made on understanding the associated kinematics. However, the ultimate cause of orogeny is still debated, especially for the case of extreme crustal thickening. Inspired by the seminal work of Holmes (1931), we explore the connections between the style of orogeny and mantle dynamics. We distinguish between two types of orogeny, those that are associated with one-sided, mainly upper mantle subduction, "slab-pull orogeny", and those related to more symmetric, whole mantle convection cells, referred to as "mantle", or "slab-suction orogeny". Only the latter leads to extreme crustal thickening. We propose that mantle orogeny is generated by the penetration of slabs into the lower mantle and the associated change in the length scales of convection. This suggestion is supported by numerical dynamic models which show that upper plate compression is associated with slab penetration into the lower mantle. Slabs can further trigger a buoyant, plume upwelling from the core-mantle boundary which enhances this whole mantle convection cell, and with it upper plate compression. We explore the geological record to test the validity of such a model. For the present-day, compressional backarc regions are commonly associated with slabs that subduct to the deep lower mantle. The temporal evolution of the Nazca and Tethyan slabs with the associated Andean Cordillera and the Tibetan-Himalayan orogenies likewise suggests that extreme crustal thickening below the Bolivia and Tibetan plateau occurred during slab penetration into the lower mantle. This episode of crustal thickening in the Tertiary bears similarity with Pangea assembly events, where the Gondwanide accretionary orogen occurred at the same time of the Variscan-Appalachian and Ural orogeny. We propose that this Late Paleozoic large-scale compression is likewise related to a change from transient slab ponding in the transition zone to lower mantle subduction. If our model is correct, the geological record of orogeny in continental lithosphere can be used to decipher time-dependent mantle convection, and episodic lower mantle subduction may be causally related to the supercontinental cycle.}

While a clear link exists between distinct margin structural domains and specific phases of rifting, the origin of strong segmentation along the length of margins remains relatively ambiguous and may reflect multiple competing factors. Given that rifting frequently initiates on heterogenous basements with a complex tectonic history, the role of structural inheritance and shear zone reactivation is frequently examined. However, the link between large-scale variations in lithospheric structure and rheology and 3-D rifted margin geometries remains relatively unconstrained. Here, we use 3-D thermo-mechanical simulations of continental rifting, constrained by observations from the Labrador Sea, to unravel the effects of inherited variable lithospheric properties on margin segmentation. The modelling results demonstrate that variations in the initial crustal and lithospheric thickness, composition, and rheology produce sharp gradients in rifted margin width, the timing of breakup and its magmatic budget, leading to strong margin segmentation.},

abstract = {Reactivation of continental transform faults (hereafter; transforms) is identified herein as a significant factor in continental break-up, based on a global review of divergent margins and numerical modelling. Divergent margins that have reactivated transforms are characterized by linear and abrupt terminations of thick continental crust. Transforms represent some of the largest structures on Earth, and these megastructures represent major lithospheric weaknesses and are therefore prone to reactivation upon changes in the stress field, which typically occur during plate break-up. The blunt termination of the margins is consistent with observations of very limited pre-breakup lithospheric thinning of such margins. This mode of break-up appears to occur abruptly, and contrasts notably with highly tapered and slowly extended divergent margins. Magma leakage along transforms is well-known worldwide where divergence occurs across such features. This leakage may evolve to dike injections, further reducing the plate strength. We observe that many of the blunt margins we attribute to transform reactivation have been prone to above-normal magmatism and are marked by seaward dipping reflectors underlain by high-velocity lower crustal intrusions. The magmatism may be directly related to the separation of abruptly terminated margins, whereby the large resulting lateral thermal gradients trigger edge-driven convection and melt addition.Supplementary material at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5756724},

abstract = {Delamination of the lower crust or lithospheric mantle is one explanation for the surface uplift observed in areas of mountain building. This process describes the removal of the lower part of the tectonic plate and can occur in various ways. Different styles of delamination typically have in common that the upper material (e.g., lowermost crust or lithospheric mantle) is denser than the underlying material (e.g., asthenosphere) and therefore sinks. It has been proposed that the higher density can be caused by the formation of eclogite. In this study we apply a thermomechanical model featuring a density increase within the lithosphere by a phase transition. The model setup is designed to investigate surface uplift and mountain building in an intracontinental setting. Specifically, the model is arranged to closely resemble central Mongolia. The models give insights into the dynamically evolving flow field with respect to the style of removal, therefore the general outcome is also applicable to other orogenic regions. In addition to a systematic study on the phase transition, we also investigate the influence of convergent motion and of the rheology of the crust. Our results reveal that for the absence of a dense (eclogite) layer, delamination initially occurs as a stationary Rayleigh-Taylor instability which appears as a late and short-lived event. In comparison, for a strong density contrast an early, long-lived peeling-off removal style with a stationary slab results. The subsequent asthenospheric upwelling causes further peeling-off events for all density contrasts. For this removal style a retreating slab is observed that occasionally breaks off giving way to a periodic behavior. The findings confirm that a strong convergence and low viscosity of the crust promote delamination. In addition, the asthenospheric upwelling yields a wide and flat surface uplift. Such dome-like features are observed to be more pronounced for high density contrasts (i.e., strong eclogitisation).}

To identify plume tracks with missing volcanism, we characterize the amplitude and timing of surface heat flux anomalies following a plume-lithosphere interaction using mantle convection models. Our numerical results confirm an analytical relationship in which surface heat flux increases with the extent of lithosphere thinning, which is primarily controlled by on the viscosity structure of the lower lithosphere and the asthenosphere. We find that lithosphere thinning is greatest when the plate is above the plume conduit, while the maximum heat flux anomaly occurs about 40-140 Myr later. Therefore, younger continental and cratonic plume tracks can be identified by observed lithosphere thinning, and older tracks by an increased surface heat flux, even if they lack extrusive magmatism.}

In addition to the classic mantle plume hypothesis, a mechanism of small-scale mantle convection at the edge of cratons (Edge Driven Convection, EDC) has been proposed due to the close proximity of the archipelago to the NW edge of the NW African Craton. A combination of mantle plume upwelling and EDC has also been hypothesized. In this study we evaluate these hypotheses quantitatively by means of numerical two-dimensional thermo-mechanical models. We find that models assuming only EDC require sharp edges of the craton and predict too narrow areas of partial melting. Models where the ascent of an upper-mantle plume is forced result in an asymmetric mantle flow pattern due to the interplay between the plume and the strongly heterogeneous lithosphere. The resulting thermal anomaly in the asthenosphere migrates laterally, in agreement with the overall westward decrease of the age of the islands. We suggest that laterally moving plumes related to strong lithospheric heterogeneities could explain the observed discrepancies between geochronologically estimated hotspot rates and plate velocities for many hotspots.}

abstract = {Abstract With a small fraction of marginal subduction zones, the driving mechanism for the North American plate motion is in debate. We construct global mantle flow models simultaneously constrained by geoid and plate motions to investigate the driving forces for the North American plate motion. By comparing the model with only near-field subducting slabs and that with global subducting slabs, we find that the contribution to the motion of the North American plate from the near-field Aleutian, central American, and Caribbean slabs is small. In contrast, other far-field slabs, primarily the major segments around western Pacific subduction margins, provide the dominant large-scale driving forces for the North American plate motion. The coupling between far-field slabs and the North American plate suggests a new form of active plate interactions within the global self-organizing plate tectonic system. We further evaluate the extremely slow seismic velocity anomalies associated with the shallow partial melt around the southwestern North America. Interpreting these negative seismic shear-velocity anomalies as purely thermal origin generates considerably excessive resistance to the North American plate motion. A significantly reduced velocity-to-density scaling for these negative seismic shear-velocity anomalies must be incorporated into the construction of the buoyancy field to predict the North American plate motion. We also examine the importance of lower mantle buoyancy including the ancient descending Kula-Farallon plates and the active upwelling below the Pacific margin of the North American plate. Lower mantle buoyancy primarily affects the amplitudes, as opposed to the patterns of both North American and global plate motions.},

abstract = {There are numerous tectonic shortening structures distributed across the planet, Mercury. As Mercury's largest single volcanic deposit, the northern smooth plains (NSP) is dominated by thrust fault-related landforms, showing particularity in their tectonic patterns compared with their counterparts in other geological terrains on Mercury. Geomorphic interpretations of these landforms assume an internal layering lithosphere to account for the deformation accommodating superficial units, implying the deformation in the NSP is thin-rooted dominated. However, the commonly used lithospheric mechanical model is an oversimplification that only allows for the sharp transition from brittle to ductile deformation, failing to explain the thin-rooted deformation well. In this work, we propose a new mechanical model incorporating the semi-brittle deformation in the lithosphere to account for an equivalent weak layer at shallow depth, filling the gap between brittle and ductile deformation. In addition, we implement 2-D numerical simulations to simulate the formation of thrust fault-related landforms in the NSP of 3.8 billion years ago. As a result, we obtain surface topographies roughly consistent with lobate scarps. Our results also support that most thrust fault-related landforms were likely formed over a period with a gradually decreased background compressive strain rate, and these landforms can retain their basic geomorphic features on this planet with little to no erosion. Although the physical properties of semi-brittle deformation are not fully understood, considering such a deformation model in planetary science is still promising, especially when studying the thermodynamic processes of a planet.}

Our quantified depth-dependent strain rate and stress history within the lithosphere, under the influence of gravitational collapse and sub-lithospheric mantle flow, show that high gravitational potential energy of a mountain chain relative to a lower Colorado Plateau can explain extension directions and stress magnitudes in the belt of metamorphic core complexes during topographic collapse. Profound lithospheric weakening through heating and partial melting, following slab rollback, promoted this extensional collapse. Landscape evolution guided northeast drainage onto the Colorado Plateau during the late Eocene-late Oligocene, south-southwest drainage reversal during the late Oligocene-middle Miocene, and southwest drainage following the late Miocene.},

In this work, we investigated the role of pre-existing weak zones and the continental lithospheric rheological layering in the formation and evolution of the intra-continental subduction based on a 2D finite element numerical technique. The model results indicate that the deeper the intra-continental weak zone is and the faster the convergence velocity is, the more likely it is to develop into a new intra-continental subduction. Altering the rheological strength of the overriding plate may not have a substantial impact on the intra-continental subduction mode when the depth of the pre-existing weak zone is larger than half of the lithospheric thickness. In contrast, the lithospheric rheological strength is closely related to the continental collision system's deformation style: Models with a weaker overriding plate are inclined to delaminate continuously under collision, whereas a strong overriding plate results in the subducting plate's roll-back. The reactivation of the suture that runs deep into the lithosphere as a result of the Indian-Asian continental collision could be one of the crucial factors controlling the formation of the south-dipping subduction under the North Pamir.}

abstract = {Abstract Subduction zones are associated with spatially heterogeneous pressure fields that, depending on location, push/pull on Earth’s surface producing dynamic topography. Despite this, subduction zones, and associated pressure fields, are typically over-simplified within global mantle flow models. Here, I use subduction models within a global domain to probe mantle pressure build-up beneath subducting plates (SPs) and the resulting dynamic topography. Positive pressure develops beneath the SP in most subduction models. This produces positive dynamic topography ( less than 450 m) and tilts the SP upwards towards the trench ( less than 0.25 m/km). As SP size increases, the magnitude of this pressure increases which, in turn, produces greater topography/tilting. At a global scale, I find potential evidence for the modeled tilting. I argue that the rigorous incorporation of subduction zones into mantle flow models, and hence the inclusion of this signal, is needed to continue to bring future dynamic topography predictions and observational estimates into closer alignment.},

abstract = {Abstract Rift-Rift-Rift triple junctions are key features of emergent plate boundary networks during fragmentation of a continent. A key example of such a setting is the Afar triple junction where the African, Arabian and Somalian plates interact. We performed analog and numerical models simulating continental break-up in a Rift-Rift-Rift setting to investigate the resulting structural pattern and evolution. We modified the ratio between plate velocities, and we performed single-stage (with all plates moving at the same time) and two-stage (where one plate first moves alone and then all the plates move simultaneously) models. Additionally, the direction of extension was changed to induce orthogonal extension in one of the three rift branches. Our models suggest that differential extension velocities in the rift branches determine the localization of the structural triple junction, which is located closer to the rift branch experiencing slower extension velocities. Furthermore, imposed velocities affect the deformation resulting in end-member fault patterns. The effect of applying similar velocities in all rift arms is to induce a symmetric fault pattern (generating a Y-shaped geometry). In contrast, a faster plate generates structures trending orthogonal to dominant velocity vectors, while faults associated with the movement of the slower plates remain subordinate (generating a T-shaped pattern). Two-stage models reveal high-angle faults interacting at the triple junction, confirming that differential extension velocities strongly affect fault patterns. These latter models show large-scale similarities with fault patterns observed in the Afar triple junction, providing insights into the factors controlling the structural evolution of this area.},

We performed a 3-D inversion of the gravity data using published geological constraints, and integrate the resulting density model with aftershock hypocenters of the earthquake event. Our results reveal steep blocks of density anomalies, with the aftershocks clustering along a prominent NW-trending, NE-dipping density contrast separating a high-density (>2708 kg/m3) footwall and lower-density (2670-2700 kg/m3) hanging wall blocks. Additionally, a secondary, SW-dipping density contrast boundary in the hanging wall coincides with a splay of aftershock hypocenter clusters at depth. Our observations suggest that the 2017 Mw6.5 Botswana earthquake is associated with the dynamic reactivation of multiple distinct strands of long-lived basement faults representing prominent deep-reaching density contrasts in the crust. As an inference from the results of gravity inversion presented in this study, we propose that such crustal-scale intraplate fault segments associated with density contrast boundaries may represent potential stress concentrators where future deep intraplate earthquakes can localize.}

The North Sulawesi subduction zone is a 5-9 myr system in Southeast Asia that has evolved from a passive continental margin and has long been overlooked by studies of passive to active margin transitions. Here we compare geophysical evidence from the region with our numerical simulation results. We find that the initial subduction of North Sulawesi relies on horizontal stress, where the trench retreat depends on the negative buoyancy of the oceanic lithosphere. Furthermore, less space available for subduction leads to reduced mantle flow caused by subduction and slower trench retreat. These new dynamical constraints indicate that the negative buoyancy of the oceanic plate is a key factor for the trench retreat, even though subduction initiated was induced.}

abstract = {Due to the Mesozoic multi-plate convergence, prominent continental marginal tectonic belts were formed in East Asia. The significant intra-continental magmatic events in the interior of East Asia were also closely related to the subduction of the surrounding oceans. Therefore, clarifying the subduction-related mantle dynamics during the Mesozoic super-convergence in East Asia is critical in understanding the crust-mantle interactions and the episodic tectono-magmatism. In this study, we obtain the subduction-related dynamic topography by coupling global mantle flow and plate reconstruction motions to capture the evolution scenarios in 200–90 Ma. Our modeling results are as follows: (1) In the Early Jurassic, the East Asian continental margin breakup is closely related to the mantle-driven dynamic topography. The offshore dynamic subsidence dominates the continental breakup. (2) The closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and the subduction of the Bangonghu-Nujiang Ocean contribute to the southward migration of the dynamic topography. Concurrently, the continuous subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate leads to the onshore dynamic uplift, which results in subduction-related orogenesis in eastern East Asia. The dynamic uplift does not massively progress westward in Mainland China, suggesting that extensive intra-continental compressional deformation results from tectonic uplift rather than mantle-induced dynamic uplift. (3) The regression of the dynamic subsidence zone since 130 Ma marks the start of the topographic collapse in the East Asian continental margin through the back-arc extension. (4) The alternating compression-extension scenarios are identified in the main compressional and extensional stages, respectively, showing that dynamic topography is closely related to the evolution of the marginal tectonic belts in eastern East Asia. In conclusion, the subduction-related dynamic topography systematically reveals the deep dynamics involved in the formation, evolution, and collapse of the marginal tectonic belts in East Asia and is of great significance in understanding the related mantle dynamics during the Late Mesozoic.}

Its formation mechanism is a hot and challenging issue in geodynamic research that involves the interaction of three-dimensional faults and stress states. In particular, the systematic and quantitative interpretation of the three-dimensional mechanism is not clear. Therefore, we use ASPECT simulation software to analyze how the main dynamic parameters affect the evolution of the basins. The following features were recognised: (1) The greater the degree of overlapping between parallel strike-slip faults, the longer the time of rapid subsidence at the initial stage, but the larger the range of subsidence and the shallower the depth of subsidence at the final stage. (2) All models generate two small basins at the beginning, but they connected together at different stages. The antithetic end-member models of different spacing faults subsided rapidly at the initial stage. However, the two independently developed small basins were connected with time. (3) Based on the comprehensive comparison of numerical modeling results with the evolution of strike-slip faulting in the Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB) in the northern South China Sea margin, this paper proposes that the 120° overlapping releasing stepover pattern is likely dominant at the early stage. Furthermore, this study finds a linear relationship between the strike-slip displacements and the depths of basin depocenter. Based on this relationship, the displacements of master strike-slip faults on both sides of the Baiyun Sag of the PRMB are less than 3.5 km. It can further help to understand the formation mechanism of the PRMB.}

abstract = {Strike-slip faults in pull‐apart basins commonly display complex 3D geometric structures, which makes it challengeable to interpret spatial and temporal evolution of the basins. Coupled thermo-mechanical and surface process models represent a powerful tool to investigate structural development of pull-apart basins and the associated sedimentary architectures. We set up three cases with representative end-member strike-slip fault patterns: 45° underlapping releasing stepover, 90° non-overlapping releasing stepover, and 135° overlapping releasing stepover. Our numerical models have successfully simulated the evolution of the developed dextral strike-slip fault systems. According to the simulation results, we found that the sediment distribution varied in each model at different stages of the basin evolution. In the beginning, the sedimentary range is the largest in the 45° underlapping releasing stepover model, but it is the smallest at the end. However, the 135° overlapping releasing stepover model showes the opposite result. Furthermore, the geometry of the basin usually depends on the underlying fault system. We observed that the activity of internal/inside faults is gradually becoming higher than that of external/outside faults as the basin evolves. Therefore, we conclude that internal normal faults are more important for basin development than external normal faults, especially in the 135° overlapping releasing stepover model. Specifically, the shape of basin basement changes from U to V at this stage because the newly developed faults are mainly concentrated in the depocenter causing rapid subsidence in the final stage of the overlapping model.}

abstract={Within extreme continental extension areas, ductile middle crust is exhumed at the surface as metamorphic core complexes. Sophisticated quantitative models of extreme extension predicted upward transport of ductile middle-lower crust through time. Here we develop a general model for metamorphic core complexes formation and demonstrate that they result from the collapse of a mountain belt supported by a thickened crustal root. We show that gravitational body forces generated by topography and crustal root cause an upward flow pattern of the ductile lower-middle crust, facilitated by a detachment surface evolving into low-angle normal fault. This detachment surface acquires large amounts of finite strain, consistent with thick mylonite zones found in metamorphic core complexes. Isostatic rebound exposes the detachment in a domed upwarp, while the final Moho discontinuity across the extended region relaxes to a flat geometry. This work suggests that belts of metamorphic core complexes are a fossil signature of collapsed highlands.},

abstract = {Abstract Paleoshorelines serve as measures of ancient sea level and ice volume but are affected by solid Earth deformation including processes such as glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and mantle dynamic topography (DT). The early Pliocene Epoch is an important target for sea-level reconstructions as it contains information about the stability of ice sheets during a climate warmer than today. Along the southeastern passive margin of Argentina, three paleoshorelines date to early Pliocene times (4.8 to 5.5 Ma), and their variable present-day elevations (36 to 180 m) reflect a unique topographic deformation signature. We use a mantle convection model to back-advect present-day buoyancy variations, including those that correspond to the Patagonian slab window. Varying the viscosity and initial tomography-derived mantle buoyancy structures allows us to compute a suite of predictions of DT change that, when compared to GIA-corrected shoreline elevations, makes it possible to identify both the most likely convection parameters and the most likely DT change. Our simulations illuminate an interplay of upwelling asthenosphere through the Patagonian slab window and coincident downwelling of the subducted Nazca slab in the mantle transition zone. This flow leads to differential upwarping of the southern Patagonian foreland since early Pliocene times, in line with the observations. Using our most likely DT change leads to an estimate of global mean sea level of 17.5 ± 6.4 m (1σ) in the early Pliocene Epoch. This confirms that sea level was significantly higher than present and can be used to calibrate ice sheet models.}

abstract = {Abstract Mantle plumes are typically considered secondary features of mantle convection, yet their surface effects over Earth's evolution may have been significant. We use 2-D convection models to show that mantle plumes can in fact cause the termination of a subduction zone. This extreme case of plume-slab interaction is found when the slab is readily weakened, for example, by damage-type rheology, and the subducting slab is young. We posit that this mechanism may be relevant, particularly for the early Earth, and a subdued version of these plume-slab interactions may remain relevant for modern subduction zones. Such core-mantle boundary–surface interactions may be behind some of the complexity of tomographically imaged mantle structures, for example, in South America. More generally, plume “talk back” to subduction zones may make plate tectonics more episodic.},

abstract = {Abstract The formation of the Central Andes dates back to ∼50 Ma, but its most pronounced episode, including the growth of the Altiplano-Puna Plateau and pulsatile tectonic shortening phases, occurred within the last 25 Ma. The reason for this evolution remains unexplained. Using geodynamic numerical modeling we infer that the primary cause of the pulses of tectonic shortening and growth of the Central Andes is the changing geometry of the subducted Nazca plate, and particularly the steepening of the mid-mantle slab segment which results in a slowing down of the trench retreat and subsequent increase in shortening of the advancing South America plate. This steepening first happens after the end of the flat slab episode at ∼25 Ma, and later during the buckling and stagnation of the slab in the mantle transition zone. Processes that mechanically weaken the lithosphere of the South America plate, as suggested in previous studies, enhance the intensity of the shortening events. These processes include delamination of the mantle lithosphere and weakening of foreland sediments. Our new modeling results are consistent with the timing and amplitude of the deformation from geological data in the Central Andes at the Altiplano latitude.},

abstract = {Abstract Despite decades of investigation, the origin of forces driving continental rifting remains highly debated. Deciphering their relative contributions is challenging due to the nonlinear and depth-dependent nature of lithospheric rheology. Recent geodynamic studies of the East African Rift (EAR) report contradicting results regarding the relative contribution of horizontal mantle tractions and lithospheric buoyancy forces. Here, we use high-resolution 3D regional numerical modeling of the EAR to isolate the contribution lithospheric buoyancy forces to observed deformation. Modeled surface velocities closely match kinematic models of the Somalian Plate, Victoria Block, and Rovuma Block motions, but provide poor fit to along-rift surface motions in deforming zones. These results suggest that lithospheric buoyancy forces primarily drive present-day ∼E-W extension across the EAR, but intrarift deformation may result from viscous coupling to horizontal asthenospheric flow.},

abstract = {Abstract We explore the connections between crustal shortening, volcanism, and mantle dynamics in the Atlas of Morocco. In response to compressional forces and strain localization, this intraplate orogen has evolved far from convergent plate margins. Convective effects, such as lithospheric weakening and plume-related volcanism, contributed in important ways to the building of high topography. We seek to better understand how crustal and mantle processes interacted during the Atlas' orogeny by combining multiple strands of observations, including new and published data. Constraints on crustal and thermal evolution are combined with new analyses of topographic evolution, petrological, and geochemical data from the Anti-Atlas volcanic fields, and a simple numerical model of the interactions among crustal deformation, a mantle plume, and volcanism. Our findings substantiate that: (a) crustal deformation and exhumation accelerated during the middle/late Miocene, contemporaneous with the onset of volcanism; (b) volcanism has an anorogenic signature with a deep source; (c) a dynamic mantle upwelling supports the high topography. We propose that a mantle plume and the related volcanism weakened the lithosphere beneath the Atlas and that this favored the localization of crustal shortening along pre-existing structures during plate convergence. This convective-tectonic sequence may represent a general mechanism for the modification of continental plates throughout the thermo-chemical evolution of the supercontinental cycle.},

The East African Rift (EAR) provides an ideal natural laboratory to elucidate the relative role of plate driving forces as only lithospheric buoyancy forces and horizontal mantle tractions act on the system. Here, we employ high-resolution 3D thermomechanical models to test whether: (a) the anomalous, rift-parallel surface deformation observed by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data in the EAR are driven by viscous coupling to northward mantle flow associated with the African Superplume, and (b) the African Superplume is the dominant source mechanism of anomalous rift-parallel seismic anisotropy beneath the EAR. We calculate Lattice Preferred Orientations (LPO) and surface deformation from two types of mantle flow: (a) a scenario with multiple plumes constrained by shear wave tomography and (b) a single superplume model with northward boundary condition to simulate large-scale flow. Comparison of calculated LPO with observed seismic anisotropy, and surface velocities with GNSS and plate kinematics reveal that there is a better fit with the superplume mantle flow model, rather than the tomography-based (multiple plumes) model. We also find a relatively better fit spatially between observed seismic anisotropy and calculated LPO with the superplume model beneath northern and central EAR, where the superplume is proposed to be shallowest. Our results suggest that the viscous coupling of the lithosphere to northward mantle flow associated with the African Superplume drives most of the rift-parallel deformation and is the dominant source of the first-order pattern of the observed seismic anisotropy in the EAR.},
