abstract = {This release includes the following changes:


	New: Choice between different formulations for the governing equations including Boussinesq and anelastic liquid approximation.
	New: Melt transport (two-phase flow).
	Particles: new generators, ghost exchange, performance improvements, interpolation to fields.
	New: Nondimensional material model for incompressible (using the Boussinesq approximation) and compressible computations (with ALA or TALA) for nondimensionalized problems. This can be used for benchmark problems like Blankenbach, King, etc..
	New: Optional DG method for temperature/composition.
	Adiabatic conditions: rework, now includes a reference density profile
	Free surface: overhaul.
	New cookbooks: continental extension, finite strain.
	New benchmarks: TanGurnis, Blankenbach, King.
	New: viscoplastic material model.
	Material model interface cleanup.
	Assembly performance improvements.
	New: memory statistics postprocessor.
	New: initial topography plugins.
	Many other fixes and small improvements.},

@article{Rose2017a,
abstract = {Mass redistribution in the convecting mantle of a planet causes perturbations in its moment of inertia tensor. Conservation of angular momentum dictates that these perturbations change the direction of the rotation vector of the planet, a process known as true polar wander (TPW). Although the existence of TPW on Earth is firmly established, its rate and magnitude over geologic time scales remain controversial. Here we present scaling analyses and numerical simulations of TPW due to mantle convection over a range of parameter space relevant to planetary interiors. For simple rotating convection, we identify a set of dimensionless parameters that fully characterize true polar wander. We use these parameters to define timescales for the growth of moment of inertia perturbations due to convection and for their relaxation due to true polar wander. These timescales, as well as the relative sizes of convective anomalies, control the rate and magnitude of TPW. This analysis also clarifies the nature of so called “inertial interchange” TPW events, and relates them to a broader class of events that enable large and often rapid TPW. We expect these events to have been more frequent in Earth's past.},

abstract = {Abstract We combine numerical modeling of lithospheric extension with analysis of seismic moment release and earthquake b-value in order to elucidate the mechanism for deep crustal seismicity and seismic swarms in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). We run 2-D numerical simulations of lithospheric deformation calibrated by appropriate rheology and extensional history of the MER to simulate migration of deformation from mid-Miocene border faults to ∼30 km wide zone of Pliocene to recent rift floor faults. While currently the highest strain rate is localized in a narrow zone within the rift axis, brittle strain has been accumulated in a wide region of the rift. The magnitude of deviatoric stress shows strong variation with depth. The uppermost crust deforms with maximum stress of 80 MPa, at 8–14 km depth stress sharply decreases to 10 MPa and then increases to a maximum of 160 MPa at ∼18 km depth. These two peaks at which the crust deforms with maximum stress of 80 MPa or above correspond to peaks in the seismic moment release. Correspondingly, the drop in stress at 8–14 km correlates to a low in seismic moment release. At this depth range, the crust is weaker and deformation is mainly accommodated in a ductile manner. We therefore see a good correlation between depths at which the crust is strong and elevated seismic deformation, while regions where the crust is weaker deform more aseismically. Overall, the bimodal depth distribution of seismic moment release is best explained by the rheology of the deforming crust.},

Depending on the density structure of these Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), the core-mantle boundary (CMB) will deform upwards or downwards due to isostatic and dynamic topography, the latter being sensitive to the viscosity structure of the lowermost mantle. Heterogeneities in the viscosity structure, although difficult to constrain, might be especially important if the LLSVPs are thermochemical piles with elevated intrinsic viscosity as suggested by mineral physics. Based on numerical models, we identify a short-wavelength (about 80-120 km wide, up to a few km deep) topographic depression that forms around the pile edges if the pile is more viscous than the surrounding mantle. The depression forms when a wedge of thermal boundary layer material becomes compressed against the viscous pile, and is enhanced by relative uplift of the CMB beneath the pile by plumes rising above it. The depth and asymmetry of the depression constrain the magnitude of the viscosity contrast between pile and the surrounding mantle. Furthermore, (periodic) plume initiation and pile collapse at the pile margin systematically modify the characteristic depression, with a maximum in asymmetry and depth at the time of plume initiation. Core-reflected waves or scattered energy may be used to detect this topographic signature of stiff thermochemical piles at the base of the mantle."

Previous studies have used geological, atmospheric, and biogenic {\textquoteleft}geomarkers{\textquoteright} to supplement supercontinent identification. However, there is no formal definition of how much continental material is required to be assembled, or indeed which geomarkers need to be present. Pannotia is a hypothesized landmass that existed in the interval \~{}0.65-0.54 Ga and was comprised of Gondwana, Laurentia, Baltica, and possibly Siberia. Although Pannotia was considerably smaller than Pangaea (and also fleeting in its existence), the presence of geomarkers in the geological record support its identification as a supercontinent. Using 3-D mantle convection models, we simulate the evolution of the mantle in response to the convergence leading to amalgamation of Rodinia and Pangaea. We then compare this supercontinent {\textquoteleft}fingerprint{\textquoteright} to Pannotian activity. For the first time, we show that Pannotian continental convergence could have generated a mantle signature in keeping with that of a simulated supercontinent. As a result, we posit that any formal identification of a supercontinent must take into consideration the thermal evolution of the mantle associated with convergence leading to continental amalgamation, rather than simply the size of the connected continental landmass.},

  ABSTRACT={Lithospheric tearing at slab edges is common in scenarios where retreating slabs face continental margins. Such tearing is often accommodated via subvertical STEP (Subduction-Transform Edge Propagator) faults that cut across the entire lithosphere and can result in sharp lateral thermal and rheological variations across the juxtaposed lithospheres. This setting favors the occurrence of continental delamination, i.e., the detachment between the crust and the lithospheric mantle. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, we have chosen a well-studied natural example recently imaged with unprecedented seismic resolution: the STEP fault under the central Betic orogen, at the northern edge of the Gibraltar Arc subduction system (westernmost Mediterranean Sea). The Gibraltar Arc subduction is the result of the fast westward roll-back of the Alboran slab and it is in its last evolutionary stage, where the oceanic lithosphere has been fully consumed and the continental lithosphere attached to it collides with the overriding plate. In this study we investigate by means of thermo-mechanical modeling the conditions for, and consequences of, delamination post-dating slab tearing in the central Betics. We consider a setup based on a STEP fault separating the orogenic Betic lithosphere and the adjacent thinned lithosphere of the overriding Alboran domain. Our model analysis indicates that delamination is very sensitive to the initial thermal and rheological conditions, transitioning from a stable to a very unstable and rapidly evolving regime. We find two clearly differentiated regimes according to the time at which the process becomes unstable: fast and slow delamination. Although the final state reached in both the fast and slow regimes is similar, the dynamic surface topography evolution is dramatically different. We suggest that given a weak enough Iberian lower crust the delaminating lithospheric mantle peels off the crust and adopts a geometry consistent with the imaged southward dipping Iberian lithosphere in the central Betics. The lack of spatial correspondence between the highest topography and the thickest crust, as well as the observed pattern of uplift/subsidence are properly reproduced by a model where relatively fast delamination (Reference Model) develops after slab tearing.}

title="The influence of variations in crustal composition and lithospheric strength on the evolution of deformation processes in the southern Central Andes: insights from geodynamic models",
journal="International Journal of Earth Sciences",
year="2021",
abstract="Deformation in the orogen-foreland system of the southern Central Andes between 33{\textdegree} and 36{\textdegree} S varies in style, locus, and amount of shortening. The controls that determine these spatially variable characteristics have largely remained unknown, yet both the subduction of the oceanic Nazca plate and the strength of the South American plate have been invoked to play a major role. While the parameters governing the subduction processes are similar between 33{\textdegree} and 36{\textdegree} S, the lithospheric strength of the upper plate is spatially variable due to structures inherited from past geodynamic regimes and associated compositional differences in the South American plate. Regional Mesozoic crustal horizontal extension generated a < 40-km-thick crust with a more mafic composition in the lower crust south of 35{\textdegree}S; north of this latitude, however, a more felsic lower crust is inferred from geophysical data. To assess the influence of different structural and compositional heterogeneities on the style of deformation in the southern Central Andes, we developed a suite of geodynamic models of intraplate lithospheric shortening for two E-W transects (33{\textdegree} 40{\textquoteright} S and 36{\textdegree} S) across the Andes. The models are constrained by local geological and geophysical information. Our results demonstrate a decoupled shortening mode between the brittle upper crust and the ductile lower crust in those areas characterized by a mafic lower crust (36{\textdegree} S transect). In contrast, a more felsic lower crust, such as in the 33{\textdegree} 40{\textquoteright} S transect, results in a coupled shortening mode. Furthermore, we find that differences in lithospheric thickness and the asymmetry of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary may promote the formation of a crustal-scale, west-dipping detachment zone that drives the overall deformation and lateral expansion of the orogen. Our study represents the first geodynamic modeling effort in the southern Central Andes aimed at understanding the roles of heterogeneities (crustal composition and thickness) at the scale of the entire lithosphere as well as the geometry of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary with respect to mountain building.",

In combination with plate reconstructions, the time-dependent pattern of paleosubduction can be simulated and is also shown from the rarely seen Antarctic perspective. Furthermore, a dynamic topography model demonstrates which kind and scales of surface manifestations can be expected as a direct and observable result of mantle convection. The last section of the chapter features an overview of the classical concept of deep-mantle plumes from a geodynamic point of view and how recent insights, mostly from seismic tomography, have changed the understanding of plume structures and dynamics over the past decades. The long-standing and controversial hypothesis of a mantle plume beneath West Antarctica is summarised and addressed with geodynamic models, which estimate the excess heat flow of a potential plume at the bedrock surface. However, the predicted heatflow is small while differences in surface heat flux estimates are large, therefore the results are not conclusive with regard to the existence of a West Antarctic mantle plume. Finally, it is shown that global mantle flow would cause tilting of whole-mantle plume conduits beneath West Antarctica such that their base is predicted to be displaced about northward relative to the surface position, closer to the southern margin of the Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Province.},

abstract = {AbstractThe lithosphere is often assumed to reside in a thermal steady-state when quantitatively describing the temperature distribution in continental interiors and sedimentary basins, but also at active plate boundaries. Here, we investigate the applicability limit of this assumption at slowly deforming continental rifts. To this aim, we assess the tectonic thermal imprint in numerical experiments that cover a range of realistic rift configurations. For each model scenario, the deviation from thermal equilibrium is evaluated. This is done by comparing the transient temperature field of every model to a corresponding steady-state model with identical structural configuration. We find that the validity of the thermal steady-state assumption strongly depends on rift type, divergence velocity, sample location and depth within the rift. Maximum differences between transient and steady-state models occur in narrow rifts, at the rift sides, and if the extension rate exceeds 0.5-2 mm/a. Wide rifts, however, reside close to thermal steady-state even for high extension velocities. The transient imprint of rifting appears to be overall negligible for shallow isotherms with a temperature less than 100°C. Contrarily, a steady-state treatment of deep crustal isotherms leads to underestimation of crustal temperatures, especially for narrow rift settings. Thus, not only relatively fast rifts like the Gulf of Corinth, Red Sea, and Main Ethiopian Rift, but even slow rifts like the Kenya Rift, Rhine Graben, and Rio Grande Rift must be expected to feature a pronounced transient component in the temperature field and to therefore violate the thermal steady-state assumption for deeper crustal isotherms.}

abstract = {Abstract Convection in fluid layers at high Rayleigh number (Ra ∼106) have a spoke pattern planform. Instabilities in the bottom thermal boundary layer develop into hot rising sheets of fluid, with a component of radial flow toward a central upwelling plume. The sheets form the “spokes” of the pattern, and the plumes the “hubs.” Such a pattern of flow is expected to occur beneath plate interiors on Earth, but it remains a challenge to use observations to place constraints on the convective planform of the mantle. Here we present predictions of key surface observables (gravity, topography, and rates of melt generation) from simple 3-D numerical models of convection in a fluid layer. These models demonstrate that gravity and topography have only limited sensitivity to the spokes and mostly reflect the hubs (the rising and sinking plumes). By contrast, patterns of melt generation are more sensitive to short-wavelength features in the flow. There is the potential to have melt generation along the spokes but at a rate which is relatively small compared with that at the hubs. Such melting of spokes can only occur when the lithosphere is sufficiently thin (  km) and mantle water contents are sufficiently high (  ppm). The distribution of volcanism across the Middle East, Arabia, and Africa north of the equator suggests that it results from such spoke pattern convection.},

abstract = {Abstract Deep-rooted mantle plumes are thought to originate from the margins of the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) at the base of the mantle. Visible in seismic tomography, the LLSVPs are usually interpreted to be intrinsically dense thermochemical piles in numerical models. Although piles deflect lateral mantle flow upward at their edges, the mechanism for localized plume formation is still not well understood. In this study, we develop numerical models that show plumes rising from the margin of a dense thermochemical pile, temporarily increasing its local thickness until material at the pile top cools and the pile starts to collapse back toward the core-mantle boundary (CMB). This causes dense pile material to spread laterally along the CMB, locally thickening the lower thermal boundary layer on the CMB next to the pile, and initiating a new plume. The resulting plume cycle is reflected in both the thickness and lateral motion of the local pile margin within a few hundred km of the pile edge, while the overall thickness of the pile is not affected. The period of plume generation is mainly controlled by the rate at which slab material is transported to the CMB, and thus depends on the plate velocity and the sinking rate of slabs in the lower mantle. A pile collapse, with plumes forming along the edges of the pile's radially extending corner, may, for example, explain the observed clustering of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) in the southeastern corner of the African LLSVP around 95–155 Ma.},

    abstract = "{Sources of stress responsible for earthquakes occurring in the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS) include not only far-field plate boundary forces but also various local contributions. In this study, we model stress fields due to heterogeneities in the upper mantle beneath the CEUS including a high-velocity feature identified as a lithospheric drip in a recent regional P-wave tomography study. We calculate velocity and stress distributions from numerical models for instantaneous 3-D mantle flow. Our models are driven by the heterogeneous density distribution based on a temperature field converted from the tomography study. The temperature field is utilized in a composite rheology, assumed for the numerical models. We compute several geodynamic quantities with our numerical models: dynamic topography, rate of dynamic topography, gravitational potential energy (GPE), differential stress, and Coulomb stress. We find that the GPE, representative of the density anomalies in the lithosphere, is an important factor for understanding the seismicity of the CEUS. When only the upper mantle heterogeneities are included in a model, differential and Coulomb stress for the observed fault geometries in the CEUS seismic zones acts as a good indicator to predict the seismicity distribution. Our modelling results suggest that the upper mantle heterogeneities and structure below the CEUS have stress concentration effects and are likely to promote earthquake generation at preexisting faults in the region’s seismic zones. Our results imply that the mantle flow due to the upper-mantle heterogeneities can cause stress perturbations, which could help explain the intraplate seismicity in this region.}",
