\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Additional shared libraries}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Additional shared libraries}


\index[prmindex]{Additional shared libraries}
\index[prmindexfull]{Additional shared libraries}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A list of names of additional shared libraries that should be loaded upon starting up the program. The names of these files can contain absolute or relative paths (relative to the directory in which you call ASPECT). In fact, file names that are do not contain any directory information (i.e., only the name of a file such as $<$myplugin.so$>$ will not be found if they are not located in one of the directories listed in the \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} environment variable. In order to load a library in the current directory, use $<$./myplugin.so$>$ instead.

The typical use of this parameter is so that you can implement additional plugins in your own directories, rather than in the ASPECT source directories. You can then simply compile these plugins into a shared library without having to re-compile all of ASPECT. See the section of the manual discussing writing extensions for more information on how to compile additional files into a shared library.


{\it Possible values:} [List list of [FileName (Type: input)] of length 0...4294967295 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Adiabatic surface temperature}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Adiabatic surface temperature}


\index[prmindex]{Adiabatic surface temperature}
\index[prmindexfull]{Adiabatic surface temperature}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} In order to make the problem in the first time step easier to solve, we need a reasonable guess for the temperature and pressure. To obtain it, we use an adiabatic pressure and temperature field. This parameter describes what the `adiabatic' temperature would be at the surface of the domain (i.e. at depth zero). Note that this value need not coincide with the boundary condition posed at this point. Rather, the boundary condition may differ significantly from the adiabatic value, and then typically induce a thermal boundary layer.

For more information, see the section in the manual that discusses the general mathematical model.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt CFL number}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:CFL number}


\index[prmindex]{CFL number}
\index[prmindexfull]{CFL number}
{\it Value:} 1.0


{\it Default:} 1.0


{\it Description:} In computations, the time step $k$ is chosen according to $k = c \min_K \frac {h_K} {\|u\|_{\infty,K} p_T}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of cell $K$, and the denominator is the maximal magnitude of the velocity on cell $K$ times the polynomial degree $p_T$ of the temperature discretization. The dimensionless constant $c$ is called the CFL number in this program. For time discretizations that have explicit components, $c$ must be less than a constant that depends on the details of the time discretization and that is no larger than one. On the other hand, for implicit discretizations such as the one chosen here, one can choose the time step as large as one wants (in particular, one can choose $c>1$) though a CFL number significantly larger than one will yield rather diffusive solutions. Units: None.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Composition solver tolerance}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Composition solver tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Composition solver tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Composition solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-12


{\it Default:} 1e-12


{\it Description:} The relative tolerance up to which the linear system for the composition system gets solved. See 'linear solver tolerance' for more details.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Dimension}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Dimension}


\index[prmindex]{Dimension}
\index[prmindexfull]{Dimension}
{\it Value:} 2


{\it Default:} 2


{\it Description:} The number of space dimensions you want to run this program in. ASPECT can run in 2 and 3 space dimensions.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 2...4 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt End time}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:End time}


\index[prmindex]{End time}
\index[prmindexfull]{End time}
{\it Value:} 5.69e+300


{\it Default:} 5.69e+300


{\it Description:} The end time of the simulation. The default value is a number so that when converted from years to seconds it is approximately equal to the largest number representable in floating point arithmetic. For all practical purposes, this equals infinity. Units: Years if the 'Use years in output instead of seconds' parameter is set; seconds otherwise.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Linear solver tolerance}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Linear solver tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Linear solver tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Linear solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-7


{\it Default:} 1e-7


{\it Description:} A relative tolerance up to which the linear Stokes systems in each time or nonlinear step should be solved. The absolute tolerance will then be $\| M x_0 - F \| \cdot \text{tol}$, where $x_0 = (0,p_0)$ is the initial guess of the pressure, $M$ is the system matrix, F is the right-hand side, and tol is the parameter specified here. We include the initial guess of the pressure to remove the dependency of the tolerance on the static pressure. A given tolerance value of 1 would mean that a zero solution vector is an acceptable solution since in that case the norm of the residual of the linear system equals the norm of the right hand side. A given tolerance of 0 would mean that the linear system has to be solved exactly, since this is the only way to obtain a zero residual.

In practice, you should choose the value of this parameter to be so that if you make it smaller the results of your simulation do not change any more (qualitatively) whereas if you make it larger, they do. For most cases, the default value should be sufficient. In fact, a tolerance of 1e-4 might be accurate enough.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Max nonlinear iterations}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Max nonlinear iterations}


\index[prmindex]{Max nonlinear iterations}
\index[prmindexfull]{Max nonlinear iterations}
{\it Value:} 10


{\it Default:} 10


{\it Description:} The maximal number of nonlinear iterations to be performed.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Maximum time step}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Maximum time step}


\index[prmindex]{Maximum time step}
\index[prmindexfull]{Maximum time step}
{\it Value:} 5.69e+300


{\it Default:} 5.69e+300


{\it Description:} Set a maximum time step size for the solver to use. Generally the time step based on the CFL number should be sufficient, but for complicated models or benchmarking it may be useful to limit the time step to some value. The default value is a value so that when converted from years into seconds it equals the largest number representable by a floating point number, implying an unlimited time step.Units: Years or seconds, depending on the ``Use years in output instead of seconds'' parameter.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Nonlinear solver scheme}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Nonlinear solver scheme}


\index[prmindex]{Nonlinear solver scheme}
\index[prmindexfull]{Nonlinear solver scheme}
{\it Value:} IMPES


{\it Default:} IMPES


{\it Description:} The kind of scheme used to resolve the nonlinearity in the system. 'IMPES' is the classical IMplicit Pressure Explicit Saturation scheme in which ones solves the temperatures and Stokes equations exactly once per time step, one after the other. The 'iterated IMPES' scheme iterates this decoupled approach by alternating the solution of the temperature and Stokes systems. The 'iterated Stokes' scheme solves the temperature equation once at the beginning of each time step and then iterates out the solution of the Stokes equation. The 'Stokes only' scheme only solves the Stokes system and ignores compositions and the temperature equation (careful, the material model must not depend on the temperature; mostly useful for Stokes benchmarks).


{\it Possible values:} [Selection IMPES|iterated IMPES|iterated Stokes|Stokes only ]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Nonlinear solver tolerance}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Nonlinear solver tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Nonlinear solver tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Nonlinear solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-5


{\it Default:} 1e-5


{\it Description:} A relative tolerance up to which the nonlinear solver will iterate. This parameter is only relevant if Nonlinear solver scheme is set to 'iterated Stokes' or 'iterated IMPES'.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Number of cheap Stokes solver steps}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Number of cheap Stokes solver steps}


\index[prmindex]{Number of cheap Stokes solver steps}
\index[prmindexfull]{Number of cheap Stokes solver steps}
{\it Value:} 30


{\it Default:} 30


{\it Description:} As explained in the ASPECT paper (Kronbichler, Heister, and Bangerth, GJI 2012) we first try to solve the Stokes system in every time step using a GMRES iteration with a poor but cheap preconditioner. By default, we try whether we can converge the GMRES solver in 30 such iterations before deciding that we need a better preconditioner. This is sufficient for simple problems with constant viscosity and we never need the second phase with the more expensive preconditioner. On the other hand, for more complex problems, and in particular for problems with strongly varying viscosity, the 30 cheap iterations don't actually do very much good and one might skip this part right away. In that case, this parameter can be set to zero, i.e., we immediately start with the better but more expensive preconditioner.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Output directory}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Output directory}


\index[prmindex]{Output directory}
\index[prmindexfull]{Output directory}
{\it Value:} output


{\it Default:} output


{\it Description:} The name of the directory into which all output files should be placed. This may be an absolute or a relative path.


{\it Possible values:} [DirectoryName]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Pressure normalization}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Pressure normalization}


\index[prmindex]{Pressure normalization}
\index[prmindexfull]{Pressure normalization}
{\it Value:} surface


{\it Default:} surface


{\it Description:} If and how to normalize the pressure after the solution step. This is necessary because depending on boundary conditions, in many cases the pressure is only determined by the model up to a constant. On the other hand, we often would like to have a well-determined pressure, for example for table lookups of material properties in models or for comparing solutions. If the given value is `surface', then normalization at the end of each time steps adds a constant value to the pressure in such a way that the average pressure at the surface of the domain is zero; the surface of the domain is determined by asking the geometry model whether a particular face of the geometry has a zero or small `depth'. If the value of this parameter is `volume' then the pressure is normalized so that the domain average is zero. If `no' is given, the no pressure normalization is performed.


{\it Possible values:} [Selection surface|volume|no ]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Resume computation}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Resume computation}


\index[prmindex]{Resume computation}
\index[prmindexfull]{Resume computation}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} A flag indicating whether the computation should be resumed from a previously saved state (if true) or start from scratch (if false).


{\it Possible values:} [Bool]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Start time}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Start time}


\index[prmindex]{Start time}
\index[prmindexfull]{Start time}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} The start time of the simulation. Units: Years if the 'Use years in output instead of seconds' parameter is set; seconds otherwise.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Surface pressure}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Surface pressure}


\index[prmindex]{Surface pressure}
\index[prmindexfull]{Surface pressure}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} The mathematical equations that describe thermal convection only determine the pressure up to an arbitrary constant. On the other hand, for comparison and for looking up material parameters it is important that the pressure be normalized somehow. We do this by enforcing a particular average pressure value at the surface of the domain, where the geometry model determines where the surface is. This parameter describes what this average surface pressure value is supposed to be. By default, it is set to zero, but one may want to choose a different value for example for simulating only the volume of the mantle below the lithosphere, in which case the surface pressure should be the lithostatic pressure at the bottom of the lithosphere.

For more information, see the section in the manual that discusses the general mathematical model.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Temperature solver tolerance}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Temperature solver tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Temperature solver tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Temperature solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-12


{\it Default:} 1e-12


{\it Description:} The relative tolerance up to which the linear system for the temperature system gets solved. See 'linear solver tolerance' for more details.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Timing output frequency}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Timing output frequency}


\index[prmindex]{Timing output frequency}
\index[prmindexfull]{Timing output frequency}
{\it Value:} 100


{\it Default:} 100


{\it Description:} How frequently in timesteps to output timing information. This is generally adjusted only for debugging and timing purposes. If the value is set to zero it will also output timing information at the initiation timesteps.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Use conduction timestep}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Use conduction timestep}


\index[prmindex]{Use conduction timestep}
\index[prmindexfull]{Use conduction timestep}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} Mantle convection simulations are often focused on convection dominated systems. However, these codes can also be used to investigate systems where heat conduction plays a dominant role. This parameter indicates whether the simulator should also use heat conduction in determining the length of each time step.


{\it Possible values:} [Bool]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Use direct solver for Stokes system}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Use direct solver for Stokes system}


\index[prmindex]{Use direct solver for Stokes system}
\index[prmindexfull]{Use direct solver for Stokes system}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} If set to true the linear system for the Stokes equation will be solved using Trilinos klu, otherwise an iterative Schur complement solver is used. The direct solver is only efficient for small problems.


{\it Possible values:} [Bool]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Use years in output instead of seconds}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Use years in output instead of seconds}


\index[prmindex]{Use years in output instead of seconds}
\index[prmindexfull]{Use years in output instead of seconds}
{\it Value:} true


{\it Default:} true


{\it Description:} When computing results for mantle convection simulations, it is often difficult to judge the order of magnitude of results when they are stated in MKS units involving seconds. Rather, some kinds of results such as velocities are often stated in terms of meters per year (or, sometimes, centimeters per year). On the other hand, for non-dimensional computations, one wants results in their natural unit system as used inside the code. If this flag is set to 'true' conversion to years happens; if it is 'false', no such conversion happens.


{\it Possible values:} [Bool]

{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`initial profile': A model in which the adiabatic profile is calculated once at the start of the model run. The gravity is assumed to be in depth direction and the composition is evaluated at reference points, no lateral averaging is performed. All material parameters are used from the material model plugin.

{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`box': A model in which the composition is chosen constant on all the sides of a box.

`initial composition': A model in which the composition at the boundary is chosen to be the same as given in the initial conditions.

Because this class simply takes what the initial composition had described, this class can not know certain pieces of information such as the minimal and maximal composition on the boundary. For operations that require this, for example in postprocessing, this boundary composition model must therefore be told what the minimal and maximal values on the boundary are. This is done using parameters set in section ``Boundary composition model/Initial composition''.

`spherical constant': A model in which the composition is chosen constant on the inner and outer boundaries of a spherical shell. Parameters are read from subsection 'Sherical constant'.

{\it Value:} box


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`box': A model in which the temperature is chosen constant on all the sides of a box.

`constant': A model in which the temperature is chosen constant on a given boundary indicator.  Parameters are read from the subsection 'Constant'.

`function': Implementation of a model in which the boundary temperature is given in terms of an explicit formula that is elaborated in the parameters in section ``Boundary temperature model|Function''. 

Since the symbol $t$ indicating time may appear in the formulas for the prescribed temperatures, it is interpreted as having units seconds unless the global input parameter ``Use years in output instead of seconds'' is set, in which case we interpret the formula expressions as having units year.

Because this class simply takes what the function calculates, this class can not know certain pieces of information such as the minimal and maximal temperature on the boundary. For operations that require this, for example in postprocessing, this boundary temperature model must therefore be told what the minimal and maximal values on the boundary are. This is done using parameters set in section ``Boundary temperature model/Initial temperature''.

The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

`initial temperature': A model in which the temperature at the boundary is chosen to be the same as given in the initial conditions.

Because this class simply takes what the initial temperature had described, this class can not know certain pieces of information such as the minimal and maximal temperature on the boundary. For operations that require this, for example in postprocessing, this boundary temperature model must therefore be told what the minimal and maximal values on the boundary are. This is done using parameters set in section ``Boundary temperature model/Initial temperature''.

{\it Description:} The formula that denotes the function you want to evaluate for particular values of the independent variables. This expression may contain any of the usual operations such as addition or multiplication, as well as all of the common functions such as `sin' or `cos'. In addition, it may contain expressions like `if(x>0, 1, -1)' where the expression evaluates to the second argument if the first argument is true, and to the third argument otherwise. For a full overview of possible expressions accepted see the documentation of the muparser library at http://muparser.beltoforion.de/.

If the function you are describing represents a vector-valued function with multiple components, then separate the expressions for individual components by a semicolon.

You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

\index[prmindexfull]{Discretization!Use locally conservative discretization}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} Whether to use a Stokes discretization that is locally conservative at the expense of a larger number of degrees of freedom (true), or to go with a cheaper discretization that does not locally conserve mass, although it is globally conservative (false).

When using a locally conservative discretization, the finite element space for the pressure is discontinuous between cells and is the polynomial space $P_ {-q}$ of polynomials of degree $q$ in each variable separately. Here, $q$ is one less than the value given in the parameter ``Stokes velocity polynomial degree''. As a consequence of choosing this element, it can be shown if the medium is considered incompressible that the computed discrete velocity field $\mathbf u_h$ satisfies the property $\int_ {\partial K} \mathbf u_h \cdot \mathbf n = 0$ for every cell $K$, i.e., for each cell inflow and outflow exactly balance each other as one would expect for an incompressible medium. In other words, the velocity field is locally conservative.

On the other hand, if this parameter is set to ``false'', then the finite element space is chosen as $Q_q$. This choice does not yield the local conservation property but has the advantage of requiring fewer degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the error is generally smaller with this choice.

For an in-depth discussion of these issues and a quantitative evaluation of the different choices, see \cite {KHB12} .

{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`box': A box geometry parallel to the coordinate directions. The extent of the box in each coordinate direction is set in the parameter file. The box geometry labels its 2*dim sides as follows: in 2d, boundary indicators 0 through 3 denote the left, right, bottom and top boundaries; in 3d, boundary indicators 0 through 5 indicate left, right, front, back, bottom and top boundaries (see also the documentation of the deal.II class ``GeometryInfo''). You can also use symbolic names ``left'', ``right'', etc., to refer to these boundaries in input files.

`sphere': Geometry model for sphere with a user specified radius. This geometry has only a single boundary, so the only valid boundary indicator to specify in the input file is ``0''. It can also be referenced by the symbolic name ``surface'' in input files.

`spherical shell': A geometry representing a spherical shell or a pice of it. Inner and outer radii are read from the parameter file in subsection 'Spherical shell'.

The model assigns boundary indicators as follows: In 2d, inner and outer boundaries get boundary indicators zero and one, and if the opening angle set in the input file is less than 360, then left and right boundaries are assigned indicators two and three. These boundaries can also be referenced using the symbolic names 'inner', 'outer' and (if applicable) 'left', 'right'.

In 3d, inner and outer indicators are treated as in 2d. If the opening angle is chosen as 90 degrees, i.e., the domain is the intersection of a spherical shell and the first octant, then indicator 2 is at the face $x=0$, 3 at $y=0$, and 4 at $z=0$. These last three boundaries can then also be referred to as 'east', 'west' and 'south' symbolically in input files.

{\it Description:} The number of cells in circumferential direction that are created in the coarse mesh in 2d. If zero, this number is chosen automatically in a way that produces meshes in which cells have a reasonable aspect ratio for models in which the depth of the mantle is roughly that of the Earth. For planets with much shallower mantles and larger cores, you may want to chose a larger number to avoid cells that are elongated in tangential and compressed in radial direction.

In 3d, the number of cells is computed differently and does not have an easy interpretation. Valid values for this parameter in 3d are 0 (let this class choose), 6, 12 and 96. Other possible values may be discussed in the documentation of the deal.II function GridGenerator::hyper\_shell. The parameter is best left at its default in 3d.

`radial constant': A gravity model in which the gravity direction is radially inward and at constant magnitude. The magnitude is read from the parameter file in subsection 'Radial constant'.

`radial earth-like': A gravity model in which the gravity direction is radially inward and with a magnitude that matches that of the earth at the core-mantle boundary as well as at the surface and in between is physically correct under the assumption of a constant density.

`radial linear': A gravity model which is radially inward, where the magnitudedecreases linearly with depth down to zero at the maximal depth the geometry returns, as you would get with a constantdensity spherical domain. (Note that this would be for a full sphere, not a spherical shell.) The magnitude of gravity at the surface is read from the input file in a section ``Gravity model/Radial linear''.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both `pi' and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)

You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

The formula is interpreted as having units W/kg.

Since the symbol $t$ indicating time may appear in the formulas for the heating rate, it is interpreted as having units seconds unless the global parameter ``Use years in output instead of seconds'' is set.

`radioactive decay': Implementation of a model in which the internal heating rate is radioactive decaying in the following rule:
\[(\text{initial concentration})\cdot 0.5^{\text{time}/(\text{half life})}\]
The crust and mantle can have different concentrations, and the crust can be defined either by depth or by a certain compositional field.

{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`S40RTS perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following the S20RTS or S40RTS shear wave velocity model by Ritsema and others, which can be downloaded here \url{http://www.earth.lsa.umich.edu/~jritsema/research.html}. Information on the vs model can be found in Ritsema, J., Deuss, A., van Heijst, H.J. \& Woodhouse, J.H., 2011. S40RTS: a degree-40 shear-velocity model for the mantle from new Rayleigh wave dispersion, teleseismic traveltime and normal-mode splitting function measurements, Geophys. J. Int. 184, 1223-1236. The scaling between the shear wave perturbation and the temperature perturbation can be set by the user with the 'vs to density scaling' parameter and the 'Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling' parameter. The scaling is as follows: $\delta ln \rho (r,\theta,\phi) = \xi \cdot \delta ln v_s(r,\theta, \phi)$ and $\delta T(r,\theta,\phi) = - \frac{1}{\alpha} \delta ln \rho(r,\theta,\phi)$. $\xi$ is the 'vs to density scaling' parameter and $\alpha$ is the 'Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling' parameter. The temperature perturbation is added to an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model).

`adiabatic': Temperature is prescribed as an adiabatic profile with upper and lower thermal boundary layers, whose ages are given as input parameters.

`function': Specify the initial temperature in terms of an explicit formula. The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

`harmonic perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following a harmonic function (spherical harmonic or sine depending on geometry and dimension) in lateral and radial direction from an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model).

`inclusion shape perturbation': An initial temperature field in which there is an inclusion in a constant-temperature box field. The size, shape, gradient, position, and temperature of the inclusion are defined by parameters.

`mandelbox': Fractal-shaped temperature field.

`perturbed box': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed slightly from an otherwise constant value equal to one. The perturbation is chosen in such a way that the initial temperature is constant to one along the entire boundary.

`polar box': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed slightly from an otherwise constant value equal to one. The perturbation is such that there are two poles on opposing corners of the box. 

`solidus': This is a temperature initial condition that starts the model close to solidus, it also contains a user defined lithoshpere thickness and with perturbations  in both lithosphere thickness and temperature based on spherical harmonic functions. It was used as the initial condition of early Mars after the freezing of the magma ocean, using the solidus from Parmentier et al., Melt-solid segregation, Fractional magma ocean solidification, and implications for longterm planetary evolution. Luna and Planetary Science, 2007.

`spherical gaussian perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed by a single Gaussian added to an otherwise spherically symmetric state. Additional parameters are read from the parameter file in subsection 'Spherical gaussian perturbation'.

`spherical hexagonal perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following an $N$-fold pattern in a specified direction from an otherwise spherically symmetric state. The class's name comes from previous versions when the only option was $N=6$.

{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} Sometimes it is convenient to use symbolic constants in the expression that describes the function, rather than having to use its numeric value everywhere the constant appears. These values can be defined using this parameter, in the form `var1=value1, var2=value2, ...'.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both `pi' and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)

{\it Value:} 0

{\it Description:} The formula that denotes the function you want to evaluate for particular values of the independent variables. This expression may contain any of the usual operations such as addition or multiplication, as well as all of the common functions such as `sin' or `cos'. In addition, it may contain expressions like `if(x>0, 1, -1)' where the expression evaluates to the second argument if the first argument is true, and to the third argument otherwise. For a full overview of possible expressions accepted see the documentation of the muparser library at http://muparser.beltoforion.de/.

You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`Morency and Doin': An implementation of the visco-plastic rheology described by (Morency and Doin, 2004). Compositional fields can each be assigned individual activation energies, reference densities, thermal expansivities, and stress exponents. The effective viscosity is defined as

 \[v_{eff} = \left(\frac{1}{v_{eff}^v}+\frac{1}{v_{eff}^p}\right)^{-1}\] where \[v_{eff}^v = B \left(\frac{\dot{\varepsilon}}{\dot{\varepsilon}_{ref}}\right)^{-1+1/n_v} exp\left(\frac{E_a +V_a \rho_m g z}{n_v R T}\right) \] \[v_{eff}^p = (\tau_0 + \gamma \rho_m g z) \left( \frac{\dot{\varepsilon}^{-1+1/n_p}} {\dot{\varepsilon}_{ref}^{1/n_p}} \right) \]

 Where $B$ is a scaling constant, $\dot{\varepsilon}$ is related to the second invariant of the strain rate tensor, $\dot{\varepsilon}_{ref}$ is a reference strain rate, $n_v$ and $n_p$ are stress exponents, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $V_a$ is the activation volume, $\rho_m$ is the mantle density, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature, $\tau_0$ is the cohestive strength of rocks at the surface, $\gamma$ is a coefficient of yield stress increase with depth, and $z$ is depth.

 The value for the components of this formula and additional parameters are read from the parameter file in subsection 'Material model/Morency and Doin'.

`Steinberger': This material model looks up the viscosity from the tables that correspond to the paper of Steinberger and Calderwood 2006 (``Models of large-scale viscous flow in the Earth's mantle with constraints from mineral physics and surface observations'', Geophys. J. Int., 167, 1461-1481, \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03131.x}) and material data from a database generated by the thermodynamics code \texttt{Perplex}, see \url{http://www.perplex.ethz.ch/}. The default example data builds upon the thermodynamic database by Stixrude 2011 and assumes a pyrolitic composition by Ringwood 1988 but is easily replaceable by other data files. 

`composition reaction': A material model that behaves in the same way as the simple material model, but includes two compositional fields and a reaction between them. Above a depth given in the input file, the first fields gets converted to the second field. 

`latent heat': A material model that includes phase transitions and the possibility that latent heat is released or absorbed when material crosses one of the phase transitions of up to two different materials (compositional fields). This model implements a standard approximation of the latent heat terms following Christensen \& Yuen, 1986. The change of entropy is calculated as $Delta S = \gamma \frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho^2}$ with the Clapeyron slope $\gamma$ and the density change $\Delta\rho$ of the phase transition being input parameters. The model employs an analytic phase function in the form $X=0.5 \left( 1 + \tanh \left( \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta p_0} \right) \right)$ with $\Delta p = p - p_{transition} - \gamma \left( T - T_{transition} \right)$ and $\Delta p_0$ being the pressure difference over the width of the phase transition (specified as input parameter).

`latent heat melt': A material model that includes the latent heat of melting for two materials: peridotite and pyroxenite. The melting model for peridotite is taken from Katz et al., 2003 (A new parameterization of hydrous mantle melting) and the one for pyroxenite from Sobolev et al., 2011 (Linking mantle plumes, large igneous provinces and environmental catastrophes). The model assumes a constant entropy change for melting 100\% of the material, which can be specified in the input file. The partial derivatives of entropy with respect to temperature and pressure required for calculating the latent heat consumption are then calculated as product of this constant entropy change, and the respective derivative of the function the describes the melt fraction. This is linearly averaged with respect to the fractions of the two materials present. If no compositional fields are specified in the input file, the model assumes that the material is peridotite. If compositional fields are specified, the model assumes that the first compositional field is the fraction of pyroxenite and the rest of the material is peridotite. 

Otherwise, this material model has a temperature- and pressure-dependent density and viscosity and the density and thermal expansivity depend on the melt fraction present. It is possible to extent this model to include a melt fraction dependence of all the material parameters by calling the function melt\_fraction in the calculation of the respective parameter. However, melt and solid move with the same velocity and melt extraction is not taken into account (batch melting). 

`multicomponent': This model is for use with an arbitrary number of compositional fields, where each field represents a rock type which can have completely different properties from the others. However, each rock type itself has constant material properties.  The value of the  compositional field is interpreed as a volume fraction. If the sum of the fields is greater than one, they are renormalized.  If it is less than one, material properties  for ``background mantle'' make up the rest. When more than one field is present, the material properties are averaged arithmetically.  An exception is the viscosity, where the averaging should make more of a difference.  For this, the user selects between arithmetic, harmonic, geometric, or maximum composition averaging.

`simple': A material model that has constant values for all coefficients but the density and viscosity. The defaults for all coefficients are chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct for Earth's mantle. All of the values that define this model are read from a section ``Material model/Simple model'' in the input file, see Section~\ref{parameters:Material_20model/Simple_20model}.

This model uses the following set of equations for the two coefficients that are non-constant: \begin{align}  \eta(p,T,\mathfrak c) &= \tau(T) \zeta(\mathfrak c) \eta_0, \\  \rho(p,T,\mathfrak c) &= \left(1-\alpha (T-T_0)\right)\rho_0 + \Delta\rho \; c_0,\end{align}where $c_0$ is the first component of the compositional vector $\mathfrak c$ if the model uses compositional fields, or zero otherwise. 

The temperature pre-factor for the viscosity formula above is defined as \begin{align}  \tau(T) &= H\left(e^{\beta (T-T_0)/T_0}\right),  \qquad\qquad H(x) = \begin{cases}                            10^{-2} & \text{if}\; x<10^{-2}, \\                            x & \text{if}\; 10^{-2}\le x \le 10^2, \\                            10^{2} & \text{if}\; x>10^{2}, \\                         \end{cases}\end{align} where $\beta$ corresponds to the input parameter ``Thermal viscosity exponent'' and $T_0$ to the parameter ``Reference temperature''. If you set $T_0=0$ in the input file, the thermal pre-factor $\tau(T)=1$.

The compositional pre-factor for the viscosity is defined as \begin{align}  \zeta(\mathfrak c) &= \xi^{c_0}\end{align} if the model has compositional fields and equals one otherwise. $\xi$ corresponds to the parameter ``Composition viscosity prefactor'' in the input file.

Finally, in the formula for the density, $\Delta\rho$ corresponds to the parameter ``Density differential for compositional field 1''.

Note that this model uses the formulation that assumes an incompressible medium despite the fact that the density follows the law $\rho(T)=\rho_0(1-\beta(T-T_{\text{ref}}))$. 

\note{Despite its name, this material model is not exactly ``simple'', as indicated by the formulas above. While it was originally intended to be simple, it has over time acquired all sorts of temperature and compositional dependencies that weren't initially intended. Consequently, there is now a ``simpler'' material model that now fills the role the current model was originally intended to fill.}

`simple compressible': A material model that has constant values for all coefficients but the density. The defaults for all coefficients are chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct for Earth's mantle. All of the values that define this model are read from a section ``Material model/Simple compressible model'' in the input file, see Section~\ref{parameters:Material_20model/Simple_20compressible_20model}.

This model uses the following equations for the density: \begin{align}  \rho(p,T) = \rho_0              \left(1-\alpha (T-T_a)\right)               \exp{\beta (P-P_0))}\end{align}

`simpler': A material model that has constant values except for density, which depends linearly on temperature: \begin{align}  \rho(p,T) &= \left(1-\alpha (T-T_0)\right)\rho_0.\end{align}

\note{This material model fills the role the ``simple'' material model was originally intended to fill, before the latter acquired all sorts of complicated temperature and compositional dependencies.}

`table': A material model that reads tables of pressure and temperature dependent material coefficients from files. The default values for this model's runtime parameters use a material description taken from the paper \textit{Complex phase distribution and seismic velocity structure of the transition zone: Convection model predictions for a magnesium-endmember olivine-pyroxene mantle} by Michael H.G. Jacobs and Arie P. van den Berg, Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors, Volume 186, Issues 1-2, May 2011, Pages 36--48.

{\it Default:} true


{\it Description:} If multiple refinement criteria are specified in the ``Strategy'' parameter, then they need to be combined somehow to form the final refinement indicators. This is done using the method described by the ``Refinement criteria merge operation'' parameter which can either operate on the raw refinement indicators returned by each strategy (i.e., dimensional quantities) or using normalized values where the indicators of each strategy are first normalized to the interval $[0,1]$ (which also makes them non-dimensional).

{\it Description:} If multiple mesh refinement criteria are computed for each cell (by passing a list of more than element to the \texttt{Strategy} parameter in this section of the input file) then one will have to decide which one should win when deciding which cell to refine. The operation that selects from these competing criteria is the one that is selected here. The options are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{plus}: Add the various error indicators together and refine those cells on which the sum of indicators is largest.
\item \texttt{max}: Take the maximum of the various error indicators and refine those cells on which the maximal indicators is largest.
\end{itemize}The refinement indicators computed by each strategy are modified by the ``Normalize individual refinement criteria'' and ``Refinement criteria scale factors'' parameters.

{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A list of scaling factors by which every individual refinement criterion will be multiplied by. If only a single refinement criterion is selected (using the ``Strategy'' parameter, then this parameter has no particular meaning. On the other hand, if multiple criteria are chosen, then these factors are used to weigh the various indicators relative to each other. 

If ``Normalize individual refinement criteria'' is set to true, then the criteria will first be normalized to the interval $[0,1]$ and then multiplied by the factors specified here. You will likely want to choose the factors to be not too far from 1 in that case, say between 1 and 10, to avoid essentially disabling those criteria with small weights. On the other hand, if the criteria are not normalized to $[0,1]$ using the parameter mentioned above, then the factors you specify here need to take into account the relative numerical size of refinement indicators (which in that case carry physical units).

You can experimentally play with these scaling factors by choosing to output the refinement indicators into the graphical output of a run.

If the list of indicators given in this parameter is empty, then this indicates that they should all be chosen equal to one. If the list is not empty then it needs to have as many entries as there are indicators chosen in the ``Strategy'' parameter.

{\it Value:} thermal energy density


{\it Default:} thermal energy density


{\it Description:} A comma separated list of mesh refinement criteria that will be run whenever mesh refinement is required. The results of each of these criteria will, i.e., the refinement indicators they produce for all the cells of the mesh will then be normalized to a range between zero and one and the results of different criteria will then be merged through the operation selected in this section.

The following criteria are available:

`composition': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the compositional fields. If there is more than one compositional field, then it simply takes the sum of the indicators computed from each of the compositional field.

`density': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from a field that describes the spatial variability of the density, $\rho$. Because this quantity may not be a continuous function ($\rho$ and $C_p$ may be discontinuous functions along discontinuities in the medium, for example due to phase changes), we approximate the gradient of this quantity to refine the mesh. The error indicator defined here takes the magnitude of the approximate gradient and scales it by $h_K^{1+d/2}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of each cell and $d$ is the dimension. This scaling ensures that the error indicators converge to zero as $h_K\rightarrow 0$ even if the energy density is discontinuous, since the gradient of a discontinuous function grows like $1/h_K$.

`maximum refinement function': A mesh refinement criterion that ensures a maximum refinement level described by an explicit formula with the depth or position as argument. Which coordinate representation is used is determined by an input parameter. Whatever the coordinate system chosen, the function you provide in the input file will by default depend on variables 'x', 'y' and 'z' (if in 3d). However, the meaning of these symbols depends on the coordinate system. In the Cartesian coordinate system, they simply refer to their natural meaning. If you have selected 'depth' for the coordinate system, then 'x' refers to the depth variable and 'y' and 'z' will simply always be zero. If you have selected a spherical coordinate system, then 'x' will refer to the radial distance of the point to the origin, 'y' to the azimuth angle and 'z' to the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is r,phi,theta and not r,theta,phi, since this allows for dimension independent expressions. After evaluating the function, its values are rounded to the nearest integer.

The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

`minimum refinement function': A mesh refinement criterion that ensures a minimum refinement level described by an explicit formula with the depth or position as argument. Which coordinate representation is used is determined by an input parameter. Whatever the coordinate system chosen, the function you provide in the input file will by default depend on variables 'x', 'y' and 'z' (if in 3d). However, the meaning of these symbols depends on the coordinate system. In the Cartesian coordinate system, they simply refer to their natural meaning. If you have selected 'depth' for the coordinate system, then 'x' refers to the depth variable and 'y' and 'z' will simply always be zero. If you have selected a spherical coordinate system, then 'x' will refer to the radial distance of the point to the origin, 'y' to the azimuth angle and 'z' to the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is r,phi,theta and not r,theta,phi, since this allows for dimension independent expressions. After evaluating the function, its values are rounded to the nearest integer.

The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

`nonadiabatic temperature': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the excess temperature(difference between temperature and adiabatic temperature.

`temperature': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the temperature field.

`thermal energy density': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from a field that describes the spatial variability of the thermal energy density, $\rho C_p T$. Because this quantity may not be a continuous function ($\rho$ and $C_p$ may be discontinuous functions along discontinuities in the medium, for example due to phase changes), we approximate the gradient of this quantity to refine the mesh. The error indicator defined here takes the magnitude of the approximate gradient and scales it by $h_K^{1.5}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of each cell. This scaling ensures that the error indicators converge to zero as $h_K\rightarrow 0$ even if the energy density is discontinuous, since the gradient of a discontinuous function grows like $1/h_K$.

`topography': A class that implements a mesh refinement criterion, which always flags all cells in the uppermost layer for refinement. This is useful to provide high accuracy for processes at or close to the surface.

To use this refinement criterion, you may want to combine it with other refinement criteria, setting the 'Normalize individual refinement criteria' flag and using the 'max' setting for 'Refinement criteria merge operation'.

`velocity': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the velocity field.

`viscosity': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from a field that describes the spatial variability of the logarithm of the viscosity, $\log\eta$. (We choose the logarithm of the viscosity because it can vary by orders of magnitude.)Because this quantity may not be a continuous function ($\eta$ may be a discontinuous function along discontinuities in the medium, for example due to phase changes), we approximate the gradient of this quantity to refine the mesh. The error indicator defined here takes the magnitude of the approximate gradient and scales it by $h_K^{1+d/2}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of each cell and $d$ is the dimension. This scaling ensures that the error indicators converge to zero as $h_K\rightarrow 0$ even if the energy density is discontinuous, since the gradient of a discontinuous function grows like $1/h_K$.

You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression.

{\it Description:} The name of the variables as they will be used in the function, separated by commas. By default, the names of variables at which the function will be evaluated is `x' (in 1d), `x,y' (in 2d) or `x,y,z' (in 3d) for spatial coordinates and `t' for time. You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A comma separated list denoting those boundaries on which the velocity is prescribed, i.e., where unknown external forces act to prescribe a particular velocity. This is often used to prescribe a velocity that equals that of overlying plates.

The format of valid entries for this parameter is that of a map given as ``key1 [selector]: value1, key2 [selector]: value2, key3: value3, ...'' where each key must be a valid boundary indicator (which is either an integer or the symbolic name the geometry model in use may have provided for this part of the boundary) and each value must be one of the currently implemented boundary velocity models. ``selector'' is an optional string given as a subset of the letters 'xyz' that allows you to apply the boundary conditions only to the components listed. As an example, '1 y: function' applies the type 'function' to the y component on boundary 1. Without a selector it will affect all components of the velocity.

Note that the no-slip boundary condition is a special case of the current one where the prescribed velocity happens to be zero. It can thus be implemented by indicating that a particular boundary is part of the ones selected using the current parameter and using ``zero velocity'' as the boundary values. Alternatively, you can simply list the part of the boundary on which the velocity is to be zero with the parameter ``Zero velocity boundary indicator'' in the current parameter section.

The names of the boundaries listed here can either by numeric numbers (in which case they correspond to the numerical boundary indicators assigned by the geometry object), or they can correspond to any of the symbolic names the geometry object may have provided for each part of the boundary.

\subsection{Parameters in section \tt Postprocess}
\label{parameters:Postprocess}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt List of postprocessors}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Postprocess/List of postprocessors}


\index[prmindex]{List of postprocessors}
\index[prmindexfull]{Postprocess!List of postprocessors}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A comma separated list of postprocessor objects that should be run at the end of each time step. Some of these postprocessors will declare their own parameters which may, for example, include that they will actually do something only every so many time steps or years. Alternatively, the text 'all' indicates that all available postprocessors should be run after each time step.

The following postprocessors are available:

`basic statistics': A postprocessor that computes some simplified statistics like the Rayleigh number and other quantities that only make sense in certain model setups.

`composition statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the compositional fields, if present in this simulation. In particular, it computes maximal and minimal values of each field, as well as the total mass contained in this field as defined by the integral $m_i(t) = \int_\Omega c_i(\mathbf x,t) \; dx$.

`depth average': A postprocessor that computes depth averaged quantities and writes them into a file $<$depth\_average.ext$>$ in the output directory, where the extension of the file is determined by the output format you select. In addition to the output format, a number of other parameters also influence this postprocessor, and they can be set in the section \texttt{Postprocess/Depth average} in the input file. 

`dynamic topography': A postprocessor that computes a measure of dynamic topography based on the stress at the surface. The data is written into a file named 'dynamic\_topography.NNNNN' in the output directory, where NNNNN is the number of the time step.

The exact approach works as follows: At the centers of all cells that sit along the top surface, we evaluate the stress and evaluate the component of it in the direction in which gravity acts. In other words, we compute $\sigma_{rr}={\hat g}^T(2 \eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u)- \frac 13 (\textrm{div}\;\mathbf u)I)\hat g - p_d$ where $\hat g = \mathbf g/\|\mathbf g\|$ is the direction of the gravity vector $\mathbf g$ and $p_d=p-p_a$ is the dynamic pressure computed by subtracting the adiabatic pressure $p_a$ from the total pressure $p$ computed as part of the Stokes solve. From this, the dynamic topography is computed using the formula $h=\frac{\sigma_{rr}}{\|\mathbf g\| \rho}$ where $\rho$ is the density at the cell center.

(As a side note, the postprocessor chooses the cell center instead of the center of the cell face at the surface, where we really are interested in the quantity, since this often gives better accuracy. The results should in essence be the same, though.)

`heat flux statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the (conductive) heat flux across boundaries. For each boundary indicator (see your geometry description for which boundary indicators are used), the heat flux is computed in outward direction, i.e., from the domain to the outside, using the formula $\int_{\Gamma_i} k \nabla T \cdot \mathbf n$ where $\Gamma_i$ is the part of the boundary with indicator $i$, $k$ is the thermal conductivity as reported by the material model, $T$ is the temperature, and $\mathbf n$ is the outward normal. Note that the quantity so computed does not include any energy transported across the boundary by material transport in cases where $\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf n \neq 0$.

As stated, this postprocessor computes the \textit{outbound} heat flux. If you are interested in the opposite direction, for example from the core into the mantle when the domain describes the mantle, then you need to multiply the result by -1.

`heat flux statistics for the table model': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the heat flux across boundaries.

`internal heating statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about internal heating, averaged by volume. 

`pressure statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the pressure field.

`spherical velocity statistics': A postprocessor that computes radial, tangential and total RMS velocity.

`temperature statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the temperature field.

`topography': A postprocessor intended for use with a free surface.  After every step, it loops over all the vertices on the top surface and determines the maximum and minimum topography relative to a reference datum (initial box height for a box geometry model or initial radius for a sphere/spherical shell geometry model).  Outputs topography in meters

`tracers': Postprocessor that propagates passive tracer particles based on the velocity field.

`velocity boundary statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the velocity along the boundaries. For each boundary indicator (see your geometry description for which boundary indicators are used), the min and max velocity magnitude is computed.

`velocity statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the velocity field.

`velocity statistics for the table model': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the velocity field.

`viscous dissipation statistics': A postprocessor that computes the viscous dissipationfor the whole domain as: $\frac{1}{2} \int_{V} \sigma : \dot{\epsilon}dV$ = $\int_{V} (-p\nabla \cdot u+2\mu\dot{\epsilon}:\dot{\epsilon} - \frac{2\mu}{3}(\nabla\cdot u)^{2}) dV$. 

`visualization': A postprocessor that takes the solution and writes it into files that can be read by a graphical visualization program. Additional run time parameters are read from the parameter subsection 'Visualization'.

\index[prmindex]{Interpolate output}
\index[prmindexfull]{Postprocess!Visualization!Interpolate output}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} deal.II offers the possibility to linearly interpolate output fields of higher order elements to a finer resolution. This somewhat compensates the fact that most visualization software only offers linear interpolation between grid points and therefore the output file is a very coarse representation of the actual solution field. Activating this option increases the spatial resolution in each dimension by a factor equal to the polynomial degree used for the velocity finite element (usually 2). In other words, instead of showing one quadrilateral or hexahedron in the visualization per cell on which \aspect{} computes, it shows multiple (for quadratic elements, it will describe each cell of the mesh on which we compute as $2\times 2$ or $2\times 2\times 2$ cells in 2d and 3d, respectively; correspondingly more subdivisions are used if you use cubic, quartic, or even higher order elements for the velocity).

The effect of using this option can be seen in the following picture showing a variation of the output produced with the input files from Section~\ref{sec:shell-simple-2d}:

\begin{center}  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{viz/parameters/build-patches}\end{center}Here, the left picture shows one visualization cell per computational cell (i.e., the option is switch off, as is the default), and the right picture shows the same simulation with the option switched on. The images show the same data, demonstrating that interpolating the solution onto bilinear shape functions as is commonly done in visualizing data loses information.

Of course, activating this option also greatly increases the amount of data \aspect{} will write to disk: approximately by a factor of 4 in 2d, and a factor of 8 in 3d, when using quadratic elements for the velocity, and correspondingly more for even higher order elements.


{\it Possible values:} [Bool]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt List of output variables}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Postprocess/Visualization/List of output variables}


\index[prmindex]{List of output variables}
\index[prmindexfull]{Postprocess!Visualization!List of output variables}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A comma separated list of visualization objects that should be run whenever writing graphical output. By default, the graphical output files will always contain the primary variables velocity, pressure, and temperature. However, one frequently wants to also visualize derived quantities, such as the thermodynamic phase that corresponds to a given temperature-pressure value, or the corresponding seismic wave speeds. The visualization objects do exactly this: they compute such derived quantities and place them into the output file. The current parameter is the place where you decide which of these additional output variables you want to have in your output file.

The following postprocessors are available:

`Vp anomaly': A visualization output object that generates output showing the anomaly in the seismic compression wave speed $V_p$ as a spatially variable function with one value per cell. This anomaly is shown as a percentage change relative to the average value of $V_p$ at the depth of this cell.

`Vs anomaly': A visualization output object that generates output showing the anomaly in the seismic shear wave speed $V_s$ as a spatially variable function with one value per cell. This anomaly is shown as a percentage change relative to the average value of $V_s$ at the depth of this cell.

`artificial viscosity': A visualization output object that generates output showing the value of the artificial viscosity on each cell.

`density': A visualization output object that generates output for the density.

`dynamic topography': A visualization output object that generates output for the dynamic topography. The approach to determine the dynamic topography requires us to compute the stress tensor and evaluate the component of it in the direction in which gravity acts. In other words, we compute $\sigma_{rr}={\hat g}^T(2 \eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\frac 13 (\textrm{div}\;\mathbf u)I)\hat g - p_d$ where $\hat g = \mathbf g/\|\mathbf g\|$ is the direction of the gravity vector $\mathbf g$ and $p_d=p-p_a$ is the dynamic pressure computed by subtracting the adiabatic pressure $p_a$ from the total pressure $p$ computed as part of the Stokes solve. From this, the dynamic topography is computed using the formula $h=\frac{\sigma_{rr}}{\|\mathbf g\| \rho}$ where $\rho$ is the density at the cell center.

Strictly speaking, the dynamic topography is of course a quantity that is only of interest at the surface. However, we compute it everywhere to make things fit into the framework within which we produce data for visualization. You probably only want to visualize whatever data this postprocessor generates at the surface of your domain and simply ignore the rest of the data generated.

`error indicator': A visualization output object that generates output showing the estimated error or other mesh refinement indicator as a spatially variable function with one value per cell.

`friction heating': A visualization output object that generates output for the amount of friction heating often referred to as $\tau:\epsilon$. More concisely, in the incompressible case, the quantity that is output is defined as $\eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u):\varepsilon(\mathbf u)$ where $\eta$ is itself a function of temperature, pressure and strain rate. In the compressible case, the quantity that's computed is $\eta [\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]:[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]$.

`gravity': A visualization output object that outputs the gravity vector.

`internal heating': A visualization output object that generates output for the internal heating rate. Units: W/kg

`material properties': A visualization output object that generates output for the material properties given by the material model.There are a number of other visualization postprocessors that offer to write individual material properties. However, they all individually have to evaluate the material model. This is inefficient if one wants to output more than just one or two of the fields provided by the material model. The current postprocessor allows to output a (potentially large) subsets of all of the information provided by material models at once, with just a single material model evaluation per output point.

`melt fraction': A visualization output object that generates output for the melt fraction at the temperature and pressure of the current point (batch melting). Does not take into account latent heat. If there are no compositional fields, this postprocessor will visualize the melt fraction of peridotite (calculated using the anhydrous model of Katz, 2003). If there is at least one compositional field, the postprocessor assumes that the  first compositional field is the content of pyroxenite, and will visualize the melt fraction for a mixture of peridotite and pyroxenite (using the melting model of Sobolev, 2011 for pyroxenite). All the parameters that were used in these calculations can be changed in the input file, the most relevant maybe being the mass fraction of Cpx in peridotite in the Katz melting model (Mass fraction cpx), which right now has a default of 15\%. The corresponding p-T-diagrams can be generated by running the tests melt\_postprocessor\_peridotite and melt\_postprocessor\_pyroxenite.

`nonadiabatic pressure': A visualization output object that generates output for the non-adiabatic component of the pressure.

`nonadiabatic temperature': A visualization output object that generates output for the non-adiabatic component of the pressure.

`partition': A visualization output object that generates output for the parallel partition that every cell of the mesh is associated with.

`seismic vp': A visualization output object that generates output for the seismic P-wave speed.

`seismic vs': A visualization output object that generates output for the seismic S-wave speed.

`specific heat': A visualization output object that generates output for the specific heat $C_p$.

`strain rate': A visualization output object that generates output for the norm of the strain rate, i.e., for the quantity $\sqrt{\varepsilon(\mathbf u):\varepsilon(\mathbf u)}$ in the incompressible case and $\sqrt{[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]:[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]}$ in the compressible case.

`thermal expansivity': A visualization output object that generates output for the thermal expansivity.

`thermodynamic phase': A visualization output object that generates output for the integer number of the phase that is thermodynamically stable at the temperature and pressure of the current point.

`viscosity': A visualization output object that generates output for the viscosity.

`viscosity ratio': A visualization output object that generates output for the ratio between dislocation viscosity and diffusion viscosity.

{\it Value:} end time


{\it Default:} end time


{\it Description:} A comma separated list of termination criteria that will determine when the simulation should end. Whether explicitly stated or not, the ``end time'' termination criterion will always be used.The following termination criteria are available:

`end step': Terminate the simulation once the specified timestep has been reached. 

`end time': Terminate the simulation once the end time specified in the input file has been reached. Unlike all other termination criteria, this criterion is \textit{always} active, whether it has been explicitly selected or not in the input file (this is done to preserve historical behavior of \aspect{}, but it also likely does not inconvenience anyone since it is what would be selected in most cases anyway).

`steady state velocity': A criterion that terminates the simulation when the RMS of the velocity field stays within a certain range for a specified period of time.

`user request': Terminate the simulation gracefully when a file with a specified name appears in the output directory. This allows the user to gracefully exit the simulation at any time by simply creating such a file using, for example, \texttt{touch output/terminate}. The file's location is chosen to be in the output directory, rather than in a generic location such as the Aspect directory, so that one can run multiple simulations at the same time (which presumably write to different output directories) and can selectively terminate a particular one.
