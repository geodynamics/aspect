\subsection{Global parameters}
\label{parameters:global}


\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Additional shared libraries}


\index[prmindex]{Additional shared libraries}
\index[prmindexfull]{Additional shared libraries}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A list of names of additional shared libraries that should be loaded upon starting up the program. The names of these files can contain absolute or relative paths (relative to the directory in which you call ASPECT). In fact, file names that are do not contain any directory information (i.e., only the name of a file such as <myplugin.so> will not be found if they are not located in one of the directories listed in the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable. In order to load a library in the current directory, use <./myplugin.so> instead.

The typical use of this parameter is so that you can implement additional plugins in your own directories, rather than in the ASPECT source directories. You can then simply compile these plugins into a shared library without having to re-compile all of ASPECT. See the section of the manual discussing writing extensions for more information on how to compile additional files into a shared library.


{\it Possible values:} [List list of <[FileName (Type: input)]> of length 0...4294967295 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Adiabatic surface temperature}


\index[prmindex]{Adiabatic surface temperature}
\index[prmindexfull]{Adiabatic surface temperature}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} In order to make the problem in the first time step easier to solve, we need a reasonable guess for the temperature and pressure. To obtain it, we use an adiabatic pressure and temperature field. This parameter describes what the `adiabatic' temperature would be at the surface of the domain (i.e. at depth zero). Note that this value need not coincide with the boundary condition posed at this point. Rather, the boundary condition may differ significantly from the adiabatic value, and then typically induce a thermal boundary layer.

For more information, see the section in the manual that discusses the general mathematical model.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt CFL number}


\index[prmindex]{CFL number}
\index[prmindexfull]{CFL number}
{\it Value:} 1.0


{\it Default:} 1.0


{\it Description:} In computations, the time step $k$ is chosen according to $k = c \min_K \frac {h_K} {\|u\|_{\infty,K} p_T}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of cell $K$, and the denominator is the maximal magnitude of the velocity on cell $K$ times the polynomial degree $p_T$ of the temperature discretization. The dimensionless constant $c$ is called the CFL number in this program. For time discretizations that have explicit components, $c$ must be less than a constant that depends on the details of the time discretization and that is no larger than one. On the other hand, for implicit discretizations such as the one chosen here, one can choose the time step as large as one wants (in particular, one can choose $c>1$) though a CFL number significantly larger than one will yield rather diffusive solutions. Units: None.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Composition solver tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Composition solver tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Composition solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-12


{\it Default:} 1e-12


{\it Description:} The relative tolerance up to which the linear system for the composition system gets solved. See 'linear solver tolerance' for more details.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Dimension}


\index[prmindex]{Dimension}
\index[prmindexfull]{Dimension}
{\it Value:} 2


{\it Default:} 2


{\it Description:} The number of space dimensions you want to run this program in. ASPECT can run in 2 and 3 space dimensions.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 2...4 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt End time}


\index[prmindex]{End time}
\index[prmindexfull]{End time}
{\it Value:} 5.6966627666142017e+300


{\it Default:} 5.6966627666142017e+300


{\it Description:} The end time of the simulation. The default value is a number so that when converted from years to seconds it is approximately equal to the largest number representable in floating point arithmetic. For all practical purposes, this equals infinity. Units: Years if the 'Use years in output instead of seconds' parameter is set; seconds otherwise.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Linear solver tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Linear solver tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Linear solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-7


{\it Default:} 1e-7


{\it Description:} A relative tolerance up to which the linear Stokes systems in each time or nonlinear step should be solved. The absolute tolerance will then be the norm of the right hand side of the equation times this tolerance. A given tolerance value of 1 would mean that a zero solution vector is an acceptable solution since in that case the norm of the residual of the linear system equals the norm of the right hand side. A given tolerance of 0 would mean that the linear system has to be solved exactly, since this is the only way to obtain a zero residual.

In practice, you should choose the value of this parameter to be so that if you make it smaller the results of your simulation do not change any more (qualitatively) whereas if you make it larger, they do. For most cases, the default value should be sufficient. However, for cases where the static pressure is much larger than the dynamic one, it may be necessary to choose a smaller value.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Max nonlinear iterations}


\index[prmindex]{Max nonlinear iterations}
\index[prmindexfull]{Max nonlinear iterations}
{\it Value:} 10


{\it Default:} 10


{\it Description:} The maximal number of nonlinear iterations to be performed.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Maximum time step}


\index[prmindex]{Maximum time step}
\index[prmindexfull]{Maximum time step}
{\it Value:} 5.6966627666142017e+300


{\it Default:} 5.6966627666142017e+300


{\it Description:} Set a maximum time step size for the solver to use. Generally the time step based on the CFL number should be sufficient, but for complicated models or benchmarking it may be useful to limit the time step to some value. The default value is a value so that when converted from years into seconds it equals the largest number representable by a floating point number, implying an unlimited time step.Units: Years or seconds, depending on the ``Use years in output instead of seconds'' parameter.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Nonlinear solver scheme}


\index[prmindex]{Nonlinear solver scheme}
\index[prmindexfull]{Nonlinear solver scheme}
{\it Value:} IMPES


{\it Default:} IMPES


{\it Description:} The kind of scheme used to resolve the nonlinearity in the system. 'IMPES' is the classical IMplicit Pressure Explicit Saturation scheme in which ones solves the temperatures and Stokes equations exactly once per time step, one after the other. The 'iterated IMPES' scheme iterates this decoupled approach by alternating the solution of the temperature and Stokes systems. The 'iterated Stokes' scheme solves the temperature equation once at the beginning of each time step and then iterates out the solution of the Stokes equation. The 'Stokes only' scheme only solves the Stokes system and ignores compositions and the temperature equation (careful, the material model must not depend on the temperature; mostly useful for Stokes benchmarks).


{\it Possible values:} [Selection IMPES|iterated IMPES|iterated Stokes|Stokes only ]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Nonlinear solver tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Nonlinear solver tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Nonlinear solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-5


{\it Default:} 1e-5


{\it Description:} A relative tolerance up to which the nonlinear solver will iterate. This parameter is only relevant if Nonlinear solver scheme is set to 'iterated Stokes' or 'iterated IMPES'.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Number of cheap Stokes solver steps}


\index[prmindex]{Number of cheap Stokes solver steps}
\index[prmindexfull]{Number of cheap Stokes solver steps}
{\it Value:} 30


{\it Default:} 30


{\it Description:} As explained in the ASPECT paper (Kronbichler, Heister, and Bangerth, GJI 2012) we first try to solve the Stokes system in every time step using a GMRES iteration with a poor but cheap preconditioner. By default, we try whether we can converge the GMRES solver in 30 such iterations before deciding that we need a better preconditioner. This is sufficient for simple problems with constant viscosity and we never need the second phase with the more expensive preconditioner. On the other hand, for more complex problems, and in particular for problems with strongly varying viscosity, the 30 cheap iterations don't actually do very much good and one might skip this part right away. In that case, this parameter can be set to zero, i.e., we immediately start with the better but more expensive preconditioner.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Output directory}


\index[prmindex]{Output directory}
\index[prmindexfull]{Output directory}
{\it Value:} output


{\it Default:} output


{\it Description:} The name of the directory into which all output files should be placed. This may be an absolute or a relative path.


{\it Possible values:} [DirectoryName]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Pressure normalization}


\index[prmindex]{Pressure normalization}
\index[prmindexfull]{Pressure normalization}
{\it Value:} surface


{\it Default:} surface


{\it Description:} If and how to normalize the pressure after the solution step. This is necessary because depending on boundary conditions, in many cases the pressure is only determined by the model up to a constant. On the other hand, we often would like to have a well-determined pressure, for example for table lookups of material properties in models or for comparing solutions. If the given value is `surface', then normalization at the end of each time steps adds a constant value to the pressure in such a way that the average pressure at the surface of the domain is zero; the surface of the domain is determined by asking the geometry model whether a particular face of the geometry has a zero or small `depth'. If the value of this parameter is `volume' then the pressure is normalized so that the domain average is zero. If `no' is given, the no pressure normalization is performed.


{\it Possible values:} [Selection surface|volume|no ]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Resume computation}


\index[prmindex]{Resume computation}
\index[prmindexfull]{Resume computation}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} A flag indicating whether the computation should be resumed from a previously saved state (if true) or start from scratch (if false).


{\it Possible values:} [Bool]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Start time}


\index[prmindex]{Start time}
\index[prmindexfull]{Start time}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} The start time of the simulation. Units: Years if the 'Use years in output instead of seconds' parameter is set; seconds otherwise.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Surface pressure}


\index[prmindex]{Surface pressure}
\index[prmindexfull]{Surface pressure}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} The mathematical equations that describe thermal convection only determine the pressure up to an arbitrary constant. On the other hand, for comparison and for looking up material parameters it is important that the pressure be normalized somehow. We do this by enforcing a particular average pressure value at the surface of the domain, where the geometry model determines where the surface is. This parameter describes what this average surface pressure value is supposed to be. By default, it is set to zero, but one may want to choose a different value for example for simulating only the volume of the mantle below the lithosphere, in which case the surface pressure should be the lithostatic pressure at the bottom of the lithosphere.

For more information, see the section in the manual that discusses the general mathematical model.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Temperature solver tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Temperature solver tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Temperature solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-12


{\it Default:} 1e-12


{\it Description:} The relative tolerance up to which the linear system for the temperature system gets solved. See 'linear solver tolerance' for more details.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Timing output frequency}


\index[prmindex]{Timing output frequency}
\index[prmindexfull]{Timing output frequency}
{\it Value:} 100


{\it Default:} 100


{\it Description:} How frequently in timesteps to output timing information. This is generally adjusted only for debugging and timing purposes.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Use conduction timestep}


\index[prmindex]{Use conduction timestep}
\index[prmindexfull]{Use conduction timestep}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} Mantle convection simulations are often focused on convection dominated systems. However, these codes can also be used to investigate systems where heat conduction plays a dominant role. This parameter indicates whether the simulator should also use heat conduction in determining the length of each time step.


{\it Possible values:} [Bool]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Use years in output instead of seconds}


\index[prmindex]{Use years in output instead of seconds}
\index[prmindexfull]{Use years in output instead of seconds}
{\it Value:} true


{\it Default:} true


{\it Description:} When computing results for mantle convection simulations, it is often difficult to judge the order of magnitude of results when they are stated in MKS units involving seconds. Rather, some kinds of results such as velocities are often stated in terms of meters per year (or, sometimes, centimeters per year). On the other hand, for non-dimensional computations, one wants results in their natural unit system as used inside the code. If this flag is set to 'true' conversion to years happens; if it is 'false', no such conversion happens.


{\it Possible values:} [Bool]

{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`box': A model in which the composition is chosen constant on all the sides of a box.

`spherical constant': A model in which the composition is chosen constant on the inner and outer boundaries of a spherical shell. Parameters are read from subsection 'Sherical constant'.

`initial composition': A model in which the composition at the boundaryis chosen to be the same as given in the initialconditions.

Because this class simply takes what the initial composition had described, this class can not know certain pieces of information such as the minimal and maximal composition on the boundary. For operations that require this, for example in postprocessing, this boundary composition model must therefore be told what the minimal and maximal values on the boundary are. This is done using parameters set in section ``Boundary composition model/Initial composition''.

{\it Value:} box


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`constant': A model in which the temperature is chosen constant on a given boundary indicator.  Parameters are read from the subsection 'Constant'.

`box': A model in which the temperature is chosen constant on all the sides of a box.

`initial temperature': A model in which the temperature at the boundaryis chosen to be the same as given in the initialconditions.

Because this class simply takes what the initial temperature had described, this class can not know certain pieces of information such as the minimal and maximal temperature on the boundary. For operations that require this, for example in postprocessing, this boundary temperature model must therefore be told what the minimal and maximal values on the boundary are. This is done using parameters set in section ``Boundary temperature model/Initial temperature''.

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Function constants}


\index[prmindex]{Function constants}
\index[prmindexfull]{Boundary velocity model!Function!Function constants}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} Sometimes it is convenient to use symbolic constants in the expression that describes the function, rather than having to use its numeric value everywhere the constant appears. These values can be defined using this parameter, in the form `var1=value1, var2=value2, ...'.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both `pi' and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)


{\it Possible values:} [Anything]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Function expression}


\index[prmindex]{Function expression}
\index[prmindexfull]{Boundary velocity model!Function!Function expression}
{\it Value:} 0; 0


{\it Default:} 0; 0


{\it Description:} The formula that denotes the function you want to evaluate for particular values of the independent variables. This expression may contain any of the usual operations such as addition or multiplication, as well as all of the common functions such as `sin' or `cos'. In addition, it may contain expressions like `if(x>0, 1, -1)' where the expression evaluates to the second argument if the first argument is true, and to the third argument otherwise. For a full overview of possible expressions accepted see the documentation of the fparser library.

If the function you are describing represents a vector-valued function with multiple components, then separate the expressions for individual components by a semicolon.


{\it Possible values:} [Anything]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Variable names}


\index[prmindex]{Variable names}
\index[prmindexfull]{Boundary velocity model!Function!Variable names}
{\it Value:} x,y,t


{\it Default:} x,y,t


{\it Description:} The name of the variables as they will be used in the function, separated by commas. By default, the names of variables at which the function will be evaluated is `x' (in 1d), `x,y' (in 2d) or `x,y,z' (in 3d) for spatial coordinates and `t' for time. You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Function constants}


\index[prmindex]{Function constants}
\index[prmindexfull]{Compositional initial conditions!Function!Function constants}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} Sometimes it is convenient to use symbolic constants in the expression that describes the function, rather than having to use its numeric value everywhere the constant appears. These values can be defined using this parameter, in the form `var1=value1, var2=value2, ...'.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both `pi' and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)


{\it Possible values:} [Anything]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Function expression}


\index[prmindex]{Function expression}
\index[prmindexfull]{Compositional initial conditions!Function!Function expression}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} The formula that denotes the function you want to evaluate for particular values of the independent variables. This expression may contain any of the usual operations such as addition or multiplication, as well as all of the common functions such as `sin' or `cos'. In addition, it may contain expressions like `if(x>0, 1, -1)' where the expression evaluates to the second argument if the first argument is true, and to the third argument otherwise. For a full overview of possible expressions accepted see the documentation of the fparser library.

If the function you are describing represents a vector-valued function with multiple components, then separate the expressions for individual components by a semicolon.

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Variable names}


\index[prmindex]{Variable names}
\index[prmindexfull]{Compositional initial conditions!Function!Variable names}
{\it Value:} x,y,t


{\it Default:} x,y,t


{\it Description:} The name of the variables as they will be used in the function, separated by commas. By default, the names of variables at which the function will be evaluated is `x' (in 1d), `x,y' (in 2d) or `x,y,z' (in 3d) for spatial coordinates and `t' for time. You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

{\it Description:} The polynomial degree to use for the velocity variables in the Stokes system. The polynomial degree for the pressure variable will then be one less in order to make the velocity/pressure pair conform with the usual LBB (Babuska-Brezzi) condition. In other words, we are using a Taylor-Hood element for the Stoeks equations and this parameter indicates the polynomial degree of it. Units: None.

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Use locally conservative discretization}


\index[prmindex]{Use locally conservative discretization}
\index[prmindexfull]{Discretization!Use locally conservative discretization}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} Whether to use a Stokes discretization that is locally conservative at the expense of a larger number of degrees of freedom (true), or to go with a cheaper discretization that does not locally conserve mass, although it is globally conservative (false).

When using a locally conservative discretization, the finite element space for the pressure is discontinuous between cells and is the polynomial space $P_ {-q}$ of polynomials of degree $q$ in each variable separately. Here, $q$ is one less than the value given in the parameter ``Stokes velocity polynomial degree''. As a consequence of choosing this element, it can be shown if the medium is considered incompressible that the computed discrete velocity field $\mathbf u_h$ satisfies the property $\int_ {\partial K} \mathbf u_h \cdot \mathbf n = 0$ for every cell $K$, i.e., for each cell inflow and outflow exactly balance each other as one would expect for an incompressible medium. In other words, the velocity field is locally conservative.

On the other hand, if this parameter is set to ``false'', then the finite element space is chosen as $Q_q$. This choice does not yield the local conservation property but has the advantage of requiring fewer degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the error is generally smaller with this choice.

For an in-depth discussion of these issues and a quantitative evaluation of the different choices, see \cite {KHB12} .

(For historical reasons, the name used here is different from the one used in the 2012 GJI paper by Kronbichler, Heister and Bangerth that describes ASPECT. This parameter corresponds to the factor $\alpha_\text {max}$ in the formulas following equation (15) of the paper. After further experiments, we have also chosen to use a different value than described there: It can be chosen as stated there for uniformly refined meshes, but it needs to be chosen larger if the mesh has cells that are not squares or cubes.)

See also the documentation of the deal.II class ``GeometryInfo''.

`spherical shell': A geometry representing a spherical shell or a pice of it. Inner and outer radii are read from the parameter file in subsection 'Spherical shell'.

The model assigns boundary indicators as follows: In 2d, inner and outer boundaries get boundary indicators zero and one, and if the opening angle set in the input file is less than 360, then left and right boundaries are assigned indicators two and three. In 3d, inner and outer indicators are treated as in 2d. If the opening angle is chosen as 90 degrees, i.e., the domain is the intersection of a spherical shell and the first octant, then indicator 2 is at the face $x=0$, 3 at $y=0$, and 4 at $z=0$.

{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} Sometimes it is convenient to use symbolic constants in the expression that describes the function, rather than having to use its numeric value everywhere the constant appears. These values can be defined using this parameter, in the form `var1=value1, var2=value2, ...'.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both `pi' and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Function expression}


\index[prmindex]{Function expression}
\index[prmindexfull]{Initial conditions!Adiabatic!Function!Function expression}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} The formula that denotes the function you want to evaluate for particular values of the independent variables. This expression may contain any of the usual operations such as addition or multiplication, as well as all of the common functions such as `sin' or `cos'. In addition, it may contain expressions like `if(x>0, 1, -1)' where the expression evaluates to the second argument if the first argument is true, and to the third argument otherwise. For a full overview of possible expressions accepted see the documentation of the fparser library.

If the function you are describing represents a vector-valued function with multiple components, then separate the expressions for individual components by a semicolon.

{\it Description:} The name of the variables as they will be used in the function, separated by commas. By default, the names of variables at which the function will be evaluated is `x' (in 1d), `x,y' (in 2d) or `x,y,z' (in 3d) for spatial coordinates and `t' for time. You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Model name}


\index[prmindex]{Model name}
\index[prmindexfull]{Material model!Model name}
{\it Value:} simple


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`Steinberger': lookup viscosity from the paper of Steinberger/Calderwood2006 and material data from a database generated by Perplex. The database builds upon the thermodynamic database by Stixrude 2011 and assumes a pyrolitic composition by Ringwood 1988. 

`latent heat': A material model that includes phase transitions and the possibility that latent heat is released or absorbed when material crosses one of the phase transitions of up to two different materials (compositional fields). This model implements a standard approximation of the latent heat terms following Christensen \& Yuen, 1986. The change of entropy is calculated as $Delta S = \gamma \frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho^2}$ with the Clapeyron slope $\gamma$ and the density change $\Delta\rho$ of the phase transition being input parameters. The model employs an analytic phase function in the form $X=0.5 \left( 1 + \tanh \left( \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta p_0} \right) \right)$ with $\Delta p = p - p_transition - \gamma \left( T - T_transition \right)$ and $\Delta p_0$ being the pressure difference over the width of the phase transition (specified as input parameter).

`simple': A simple material model that has constant values for all coefficients but the density and viscosity. This model uses the formulation that assumes an incompressible medium despite the fact that the density follows the law $\rho(T)=\rho_0(1-\beta(T-T_{\text{ref}})$. The temperature dependency of viscosity is  switched off by default and follows the formula$\eta(T)=\eta_0*e^{\eta_T*\Delta T / T_{\text{ref}})}$.The value for the components of this formula and additional parameters are read from the parameter file in subsection 'Simple model'.

`Tan Gurnis': A simple compressible material model based on a benchmark from the paper of Tan/Gurnis (2007). This does not use the temperature equation, but has a hardcoded temperature.

`table': A material model that reads tables of pressure and temperature dependent material coefficients from files. The default values for this model's runtime parameters use a material description taken from the paper \textit{Complex phase distribution and seismic velocity structure of the transition zone: Convection model predictions for a magnesium-endmember olivine-pyroxene mantle} by Michael H.G. Jacobs and Arie P. van den Berg, Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors, Volume 186, Issues 1-2, May 2011, Pages 36--48. See \url{http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920111000422}.

`SolCx': A material model that corresponds to the 'SolCx' benchmark defined in Duretz et al., G-Cubed, 2011.

`SolKz': A material model that corresponds to the 'SolKz' benchmark defined in Duretz et al., G-Cubed, 2011.

`Inclusion': A material model that corresponds to the 'Inclusion' benchmark defined in Duretz et al., G-Cubed, 2011.

{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} If compositional fields are used, then one would frequently want to make the density depend on these fields. In this simple material model, we make the following assumptions: if no compositional fields are used in the current simulation, then the density is simply the usual one with its linear dependence on the temperature. If there are compositional fields, then the density only depends on the first one in such a way that the density has an additional term of the kind $+\Delta \rho \; c_1(\mathbf x)$. This parameter describes the value of $\Delta \rho$. Units: $kg/m^3/\textrm{unit change in composition}$.

{\it Value:} true

{\it Description:} If multiple refinement criteria are specified in the ``Strategy'' parameter, then they need to be combined somehow to form the final refinement indicators. This is done using the method described by the ``Refinement criteria merge operation'' parameter which can either operate on the raw refinement indicators returned by each strategy (i.e., dimensional quantities) or using normalized values where the indicators of each strategy are first normalized to the interval $[0,1]$ (which also makes them non-dimensional).

{\it Description:} If multiple mesh refinement criteria are computed for each cell (by passing a list of more than element to the \texttt{Strategy} parameter in this section of the input file) then one will have to decide which one should win when deciding which cell to refine. The operation that selects from these competing criteria is the one that is selected here. The options are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{plus}: Add the various error indicators together and refine those cells on which the sum of indicators is largest.
\item \texttt{max}: Take the maximum of the various error indicators and refine those cells on which the maximal indicators is largest.

On the other hand, if multiple criteria are chosen, then these factors are used to weigh the various indicators relative to each other. 

If ``Normalize individual refinement criteria'' is set to true, then the criteria will first be normalized to the interval $[0,1]$ and then multiplied by the factors specified here. You will likely want to choose the factors to be not too far from 1 in that case, say between 1 and 10, to avoid essentially disabling those criteria with small weights. On the other hand, if the criteria are not normalized to $[0,1]$ using the parameter mentioned above, then the factors you specify here need to take into account the relative numerical size of refinement indicators (which in that case carry physical units).

You can experimentally play with these scaling factors by choosing to output the refinement indicators into the graphical output of a run.

If the list of indicators given in this parameter is empty, then this indicates that they should all be chosen equal to one. If the list is not empty then it needs to have as many entries as there are indicators chosen in the ``Strategy'' parameter.

{\it Description:} A comma separated list of mesh refinement criteria that will be run whenever mesh refinement is required. The results of each of these criteria will, i.e., the refinement indicators they produce for all the cells of the mesh will then be normalized to a range between zero and one and the results of different criteria will then be merged through the operation selected in this section.

The following criteria are available:

`viscosity': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from a field that describes the spatial variability of the logarithm of the viscosity, $\log\eta$. (We choose the logarithm of the viscosity because it can vary by orders of magnitude.)Because this quantity may not be a continuous function ($\eta$ may be a discontinuous function along discontinuities in the medium, for example due to phase changes), we approximate the gradient of this quantity to refine the mesh. The error indicator defined here takes the magnitude of the approximate gradient and scales it by $h_K^{1+d/2}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of each cell and $d$ is the dimension. This scaling ensures that the error indicators converge to zero as $h_K\rightarrow 0$ even if the energy density is discontinuous, since the gradient of a discontinuous function grows like $1/h_K$.

`velocity': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the velocity field.

`temperature': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the temperature field.

`density': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from a field that describes the spatial variability of the density, $\rho$. Because this quantity may not be a continuous function ($\rho$ and $C_p$ may be discontinuous functions along discontinuities in the medium, for example due to phase changes), we approximate the gradient of this quantity to refine the mesh. The error indicator defined here takes the magnitude of the approximate gradient and scales it by $h_K^{1+d/2}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of each cell and $d$ is the dimension. This scaling ensures that the error indicators converge to zero as $h_K\rightarrow 0$ even if the energy density is discontinuous, since the gradient of a discontinuous function grows like $1/h_K$.

`topography': A class that implements a mesh refinement criterion, which always flags all cells in the uppermost layer for refinement. This is useful to provide high accuracy for processes at or close to the surface.

To use this refinement criterion, you may want to combine it with other refinement criteria, setting the 'Normalize individual refinement criteria' flag and using the 'max' setting for 'Refinement criteria merge operation'.

`composition': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the compositional fields. If there is more than one compositional field, then it simply takes the sum of the indicators computed from each of the compositional field.

`thermal energy density': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from a field that describes the spatial variability of the thermal energy density, $\rho C_p T$. Because this quantity may not be a continuous function ($\rho$ and $C_p$ may be discontinuous functions along discontinuities in the medium, for example due to phase changes), we approximate the gradient of this quantity to refine the mesh. The error indicator defined here takes the magnitude of the approximate gradient and scales it by $h_K^{1.5}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of each cell. This scaling ensures that the error indicators converge to zero as $h_K\rightarrow 0$ even if the energy density is discontinuous, since the gradient of a discontinuous function grows like $1/h_K$.

`nonadiabatic temperature': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the excess temperature(difference between temperature and adiabatic temperature.

All boundary indicators used by the geometry but not explicitly listed here will end up with no-flux (insulating) boundary conditions.

This parameter only describes which boundaries have a fixed composition, but not what composition should hold on these boundaries.

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Prescribed velocity boundary indicators}


\index[prmindex]{Prescribed velocity boundary indicators}
\index[prmindexfull]{Model settings!Prescribed velocity boundary indicators}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A comma separated list denoting those boundaries on which the velocity is tangential but prescribed, i.e., where external forces act to prescribe a particular velocity. This is often used to prescribe a velocity that equals that of overlying plates.

The format of valid entries for this parameter is that of a map given as ``key1 [selector]: value1, key2 [selector]: value2, key3: value3, ...'' where each key must be a valid boundary indicator (which is an integer) and each value must be one of the currently implemented boundary velocity models. selector is an optional string given as a subset of the letters 'xyz' that allows you to apply the boundary conditions only to the components listed. As an example, '1 y: function' applies the type 'function' to the y component on boundary 1. Without a selector it will effect all components of the velocity.

Note that the no-slip boundary condition is a special case of the current one where the prescribed velocity happens to be zero. It can thus be implemented by indicating that a particular boundary is part of the ones selected using the current parameter and using ``zero velocity'' as the boundary values. Alternatively, you can simply list the part of the boundary on which the velocity is to be zero with the parameter ``Zero velocity boundary indicator'' in the current parameter section.

{\it Description:} A selection of operations to remove certain parts of the nullspace from the velocity after solving. For some geometries and certain boundary conditions the velocity field is not uniquely determined but contains free translations and or rotations. Depending on what you specify here, these non-determined modes will be removed from the velocity field at the end of the Stokes solve step.
Note that while more than operation can be selected it only makes sense to pick one rotational and one translational operation.

\subsection{Parameters in section \tt Postprocess}
\label{parameters:Postprocess}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt List of postprocessors}


\index[prmindex]{List of postprocessors}
\index[prmindexfull]{Postprocess!List of postprocessors}
{\it Value:} all


{\it Default:} all


{\it Description:} A comma separated list of postprocessor objects that should be run at the end of each time step. Some of these postprocessors will declare their own parameters which may, for example, include that they will actually do something only every so many time steps or years. Alternatively, the text 'all' indicates that all available postprocessors should be run after each time step.

The following postprocessors are available:

`velocity statistics for the table model': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the velocity field.

`heat flux statistics for the table model': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the heat flux across boundaries.

`visualization': A postprocessor that takes the solution and writes it into files that can be read by a graphical visualization program. Additional run time parameters are read from the parameter subsection 'Visualization'.

`temperature statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the temperature field.

`composition statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the compositional fields, if present in this simulation. In particular, it computes maximal and minimal values of each field, as well as the total mass contained in this field as defined by the integral $m_i(t) = \int_\Omega c_i(\mathbf x,t) \; dx$.

`heat flux statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the (conductive) heat flux across boundaries. For each boundary indicator (see your geometry description for which boundary indicators are used), the heat flux is computed in outward direction, i.e., from the domain to the outside, using the formula $\int_{\Gamma_i} k \nabla T \cdot \mathbf n$ where $\Gamma_i$ is the part of the boundary with indicator $i$, $k$ is the thermal conductivity as reported by the material model, $T$ is the temperature, and $\mathbf n$ is the outward normal. Note that the quantity so computed does not include any energy transported across the boundary by material transport in cases where $\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf n \neq 0$.

As stated, this postprocessor computes the \textit{outbound} heat flux. If you are interested in the opposite direction, for example from the core into the mantle when the domain describes the mantle, then you need to multiply the result by -1.

`Tan Gurnis error': A postprocessor that compares the solution of the benchmarks from the Tan/Gurnis (2007) paper with the one computed by ASPECT by outputing data that is compared using a matlab script.

`depth average': A postprocessor that computes depth averaged quantities and writes them into a file <depth\_average.ext> in the output directory, where the extension of the file is determined by the output format you select. In addition to the output format, a number of other parameters also influence this postprocessor, and they can be set in the section \texttt{Postprocess/Depth average} in the input file. 

`DuretzEtAl error': A postprocessor that compares the solution of the benchmarks from the Duretz et al., G-Cubed, 2011, paper with the one computed by ASPECT and reports the error. Specifically, it can compute the errors for the SolCx, SolKz and inclusion benchmarks. The postprocessor inquires which material model is currently being used and adjusts which exact solution to use accordingly.

`tracers': Postprocessor that propagates passive tracer particles based on the velocity field.

`velocity statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the velocity field.

`dynamic topography': A postprocessor that computes a measure of dynamic topography based on the stress at the surface. The data is writte into a file named 'dynamic\_topography.NNNNN' in the output directory, where NNNNN is the number of the time step.

The exact approach works as follows: At the centers of all cells that sit along the top surface, we evaluate the stress and evaluate the component of it in the direction in which gravity acts. In other words, we compute $\sigma_{rr}={\hat g}^T(2 \eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u))\hat g$ where $\hat g = \mathbf g/\|\mathbf g\|$ is the direction of the gravity vector $\mathbf g$. From this, the dynamic topography is computed using the formula $h=\frac{\sigma_{rr}}{\|\mathbf g\| \rho}$ where $\rho$ is the density at the cell center.

(As a side note, the postprocessor chooses the cell center instead of the center of the cell face at the surface, where we really are interested in the quantity, since this often gives better accuracy. The results should in essence be the same, though.)

{\it Description:} The number of zones in depth direction within which we are to compute averages. By default, we subdivide the entire domain into 100 depth zones and compute temperature and other averages within each of these zones. However, if you have a very coarse mesh, it may not make much sense to subdivide the domain into so many zones and you may wish to choose less than this default. It may also make computations slightly faster. On the other hand, if you have an extremely highly resolved mesh, choosing more zones might also make sense.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt List of output variables}


\index[prmindex]{List of output variables}
\index[prmindexfull]{Postprocess!Visualization!List of output variables}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A comma separated list of visualization objects that should be run whenever writing graphical output. By default, the graphical output files will always contain the primary variables velocity, pressure, and temperature. However, one frequently wants to also visualize derived quantities, such as the thermodynamic phase that corresponds to a given temperature-pressure value, or the corresponding seismic wave speeds. The visualization objects do exactly this: they compute such derived quantities and place them into the output file. The current parameter is the place where you decide which of these additional output variables you want to have in your output file.

The following postprocessors are available:

`nonadiabatic pressure': A visualization output object that generates output for the non-adiabatic component of the pressure.

`melt fraction': A visualization output object that generates output for the melt fraction at the temperature and pressure of the current point (batch melting). Does not take into account latent heat.

`strain rate': A visualization output object that generates output for the norm of the strain rate, i.e., for the quantity $\sqrt{\varepsilon(\mathbf u):\varepsilon(\mathbf u)}$ in the incompressible case and $\sqrt{[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]:[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]}$ in the compressible case.

`Vs anomaly': A visualization output object that generates output showing the anomaly in the seismic shear wave speed $V_s$ as a spatially variable function with one value per cell. This anomaly is shown as a percentage change relative to the average value of $V_s$ at the depth of this cell.

`Vp anomaly': A visualization output object that generates output showing the anomaly in the seismic compression wave speed $V_p$ as a spatially variable function with one value per cell. This anomaly is shown as a percentage change relative to the average value of $V_p$ at the depth of this cell.

`seismic vs': A visualization output object that generates output for the seismic S-wave speed.

`specific heat': A visualization output object that generates output for the specific heat $C_p$.

`viscosity': A visualization output object that generates output for the viscosity.

`friction heating': A visualization output object that generates output for the amount of friction heating often referred to as $\tau:\epsilon$. More concisely, in the incompressible case, the quantity that is output is defined as $\eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u):\varepsilon(\mathbf u)$ where $\eta$ is itself a function of temperature, pressure and strain rate. In the compressible case, the quantity that's computed is $\eta [\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]:[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]$.

`density': A visualization output object that generates output for the density.

`artificial viscosity': A visualization output object that generates output showing the value of the artificial viscosity on each cell.

`viscosity ratio': A visualization output object that generates output for the ratio between dislocation viscosity and diffusion viscosity.

`error indicator': A visualization output object that generates output showing the estimated error or other mesh refinement indicator as a spatially variable function with one value per cell.

`thermal expansivity': A visualization output object that generates output for the thermal expansivity.

`seismic vp': A visualization output object that generates output for the seismic P-wave speed.

`dynamic topography': A visualization output object that generates output for the dynamic topography. The approach to determine the dynamic topography requires us to compute the stress tensor and evaluate the component of it in the direction in which gravity acts. In other words, we compute $\sigma_{rr}={\hat g}^T(2 * \eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u))\hat g$ where $\hat g = \mathbf g/\|\mathbf g\|$ is the direction of the gravity vector $\mathbf g$. From this, the dynamic topography is computed using the formula $h=\frac{\sigma_{rr}}{\|\mathbf g\| \rho}$ where $\rho$ is the density at the cell center.

Strictly speaking, the dynamic topography is of course a quantity that is only of interest at the surface. However, we compute it everywhere to make things fit into the framework within which we produce data for visualization. You probably only want to visualize whatever data this postprocessor generates at the surface of your domain and simply ignore the rest of the data generated.

`nonadiabatic temperature': A visualization output object that generates output for the non-adiabatic component of the pressure.

`partition': A visualization output object that generates output for the parallel partition that every cell of the mesh is associated with.

`thermodynamic phase': A visualization output object that generates output for the integer number of the phase that is thermodynamically stable at the temperature and pressure of the current point.

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Termination criteria}


\index[prmindex]{Termination criteria}
\index[prmindexfull]{Termination criteria!Termination criteria}
{\it Value:} end time


{\it Default:} end time


{\it Description:} A comma separated list of termination criteria that will determine when the simulation should end. Whether explicitly stated or not, the ``end time'' termination criterion will always be used.The following termination criteria are available:

`end time': Terminate the simulation once the end time specified in the input file has been reached. Unlike all other termination criteria, this criterion is \textit{always} active, whether it has been explicitly selected or not in the input file (this is done to preserve historical behavior of \aspect{}, but it also likely does not inconvenience anyone since it is what would be selected in most cases anyway).

`end step': Terminate the simulation once the specified timestep has been reached. 

`user request': Terminate the simulation gracefully when a file with a specified name appears in the output directory. This allows the user to gracefully exit the simulation at any time by simply creating such a file using, for example, \texttt{touch output/terminate}. The file's location is chosen to be in the output directory, rather than in a generic location such as the Aspect directory, so that one can run multiple simulations at the same time (which presumably write to different output directories) and can selectively terminate a particular one.

`steady state velocity': A criterion that terminates the simulation when the RMS of the velocity field stays within a certain range for a specified period of time.
