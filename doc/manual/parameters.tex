\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Additional shared libraries}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Additional shared libraries}


\index[prmindex]{Additional shared libraries}
\index[prmindexfull]{Additional shared libraries}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A list of names of additional shared libraries that should be loaded upon starting up the program. The names of these files can contain absolute or relative paths (relative to the directory in which you call ASPECT). In fact, file names that are do not contain any directory information (i.e., only the name of a file such as $<$myplugin.so$>$ will not be found if they are not located in one of the directories listed in the \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} environment variable. In order to load a library in the current directory, use $<$./myplugin.so$>$ instead.

The typical use of this parameter is so that you can implement additional plugins in your own directories, rather than in the ASPECT source directories. You can then simply compile these plugins into a shared library without having to re-compile all of ASPECT. See the section of the manual discussing writing extensions for more information on how to compile additional files into a shared library.


{\it Possible values:} [List list of [FileName (Type: input)] of length 0...4294967295 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Adiabatic surface temperature}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Adiabatic surface temperature}


\index[prmindex]{Adiabatic surface temperature}
\index[prmindexfull]{Adiabatic surface temperature}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} In order to make the problem in the first time step easier to solve, we need a reasonable guess for the temperature and pressure. To obtain it, we use an adiabatic pressure and temperature field. This parameter describes what the `adiabatic' temperature would be at the surface of the domain (i.e. at depth zero). Note that this value need not coincide with the boundary condition posed at this point. Rather, the boundary condition may differ significantly from the adiabatic value, and then typically induce a thermal boundary layer.

For more information, see the section in the manual that discusses the general mathematical model.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt CFL number}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:CFL number}


\index[prmindex]{CFL number}
\index[prmindexfull]{CFL number}
{\it Value:} 1.0


{\it Default:} 1.0


{\it Description:} In computations, the time step $k$ is chosen according to $k = c \min_K \frac {h_K} {\|u\|_{\infty,K} p_T}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of cell $K$, and the denominator is the maximal magnitude of the velocity on cell $K$ times the polynomial degree $p_T$ of the temperature discretization. The dimensionless constant $c$ is called the CFL number in this program. For time discretizations that have explicit components, $c$ must be less than a constant that depends on the details of the time discretization and that is no larger than one. On the other hand, for implicit discretizations such as the one chosen here, one can choose the time step as large as one wants (in particular, one can choose $c>1$) though a CFL number significantly larger than one will yield rather diffusive solutions. Units: None.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Composition solver tolerance}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Composition solver tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Composition solver tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Composition solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-12


{\it Default:} 1e-12


{\it Description:} The relative tolerance up to which the linear system for the composition system gets solved. See 'linear solver tolerance' for more details.

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Dimension}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Dimension}


\index[prmindex]{Dimension}
\index[prmindexfull]{Dimension}
{\it Value:} 2


{\it Default:} 2


{\it Description:} The number of space dimensions you want to run this program in. ASPECT can run in 2 and 3 space dimensions.

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt End time}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:End time}


\index[prmindex]{End time}
\index[prmindexfull]{End time}
{\it Value:} 5.69e+300


{\it Default:} 5.69e+300


{\it Description:} The end time of the simulation. The default value is a number so that when converted from years to seconds it is approximately equal to the largest number representable in floating point arithmetic. For all practical purposes, this equals infinity. Units: Years if the 'Use years in output instead of seconds' parameter is set; seconds otherwise.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Linear solver A block tolerance}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Linear solver A block tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Linear solver A block tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Linear solver A block tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-2


{\it Default:} 1e-2


{\it Description:} A relative tolerance up to which the approximate inverse of the A block of the Stokes system is computed. This approximate A is used in the preconditioning used in the GMRES solver.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Linear solver S block tolerance}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Linear solver S block tolerance}

{\it Value:} 1e-6


{\it Default:} 1e-6


{\it Description:} A relative tolerance up to which the approximate inverse of the S block (Schur complement matrix, $S = BA^{-1}B^{T}$) of the Stokes system is computed. This approximate inverse of the S block is used in the preconditioning used in the GMRES solver.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Linear solver tolerance}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Linear solver tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Linear solver tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Linear solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-7


{\it Default:} 1e-7


{\it Description:} A relative tolerance up to which the linear Stokes systems in each time or nonlinear step should be solved. The absolute tolerance will then be $\| M x_0 - F \| \cdot \text{tol}$, where $x_0 = (0,p_0)$ is the initial guess of the pressure, $M$ is the system matrix, F is the right-hand side, and tol is the parameter specified here. We include the initial guess of the pressure to remove the dependency of the tolerance on the static pressure. A given tolerance value of 1 would mean that a zero solution vector is an acceptable solution since in that case the norm of the residual of the linear system equals the norm of the right hand side. A given tolerance of 0 would mean that the linear system has to be solved exactly, since this is the only way to obtain a zero residual.

In practice, you should choose the value of this parameter to be so that if you make it smaller the results of your simulation do not change any more (qualitatively) whereas if you make it larger, they do. For most cases, the default value should be sufficient. In fact, a tolerance of 1e-4 might be accurate enough.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Max nonlinear iterations}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Max nonlinear iterations}


\index[prmindex]{Max nonlinear iterations}
\index[prmindexfull]{Max nonlinear iterations}
{\it Value:} 10


{\it Default:} 10


{\it Description:} The maximal number of nonlinear iterations to be performed.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Max nonlinear iterations in pre-refinement}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Max nonlinear iterations in pre-refinement}


\index[prmindex]{Max nonlinear iterations in pre-refinement}
\index[prmindexfull]{Max nonlinear iterations in pre-refinement}
{\it Value:} 2147483647


{\it Default:} 2147483647


{\it Description:} The maximal number of nonlinear iterations to be performed in the pre-refinement steps. This does not include the last refinement step before moving to timestep 1. When this parameter has a larger value than max nonlinear iterations, the latter is used.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Maximum time step}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Maximum time step}


\index[prmindex]{Maximum time step}
\index[prmindexfull]{Maximum time step}
{\it Value:} 5.69e+300


{\it Default:} 5.69e+300


{\it Description:} Set a maximum time step size for the solver to use. Generally the time step based on the CFL number should be sufficient, but for complicated models or benchmarking it may be useful to limit the time step to some value. The default value is a value so that when converted from years into seconds it equals the largest number representable by a floating point number, implying an unlimited time step.Units: Years or seconds, depending on the ``Use years in output instead of seconds'' parameter.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Nonlinear solver scheme}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Nonlinear solver scheme}


\index[prmindex]{Nonlinear solver scheme}
\index[prmindexfull]{Nonlinear solver scheme}
{\it Value:} IMPES


{\it Default:} IMPES


{\it Description:} The kind of scheme used to resolve the nonlinearity in the system. 'IMPES' is the classical IMplicit Pressure Explicit Saturation scheme in which ones solves the temperatures and Stokes equations exactly once per time step, one after the other. The 'iterated IMPES' scheme iterates this decoupled approach by alternating the solution of the temperature and Stokes systems. The 'iterated Stokes' scheme solves the temperature equation once at the beginning of each time step and then iterates out the solution of the Stokes equation. The 'Stokes only' scheme only solves the Stokes system and ignores compositions and the temperature equation (careful, the material model must not depend on the temperature; mostly useful for Stokes benchmarks). The 'Advection only'scheme only solves the temperature and other advection systems and instead of solving for the Stokes system, a prescribed velocity and pressure is used


{\it Possible values:} [Selection IMPES|iterated IMPES|iterated Stokes|Stokes only|Advection only ]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Nonlinear solver tolerance}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Nonlinear solver tolerance}


\index[prmindex]{Nonlinear solver tolerance}
\index[prmindexfull]{Nonlinear solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-5


{\it Default:} 1e-5


{\it Description:} A relative tolerance up to which the nonlinear solver will iterate. This parameter is only relevant if Nonlinear solver scheme is set to 'iterated Stokes' or 'iterated IMPES'.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Number of cheap Stokes solver steps}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Number of cheap Stokes solver steps}


\index[prmindex]{Number of cheap Stokes solver steps}
\index[prmindexfull]{Number of cheap Stokes solver steps}
{\it Value:} 30


{\it Default:} 30


{\it Description:} As explained in the ASPECT paper (Kronbichler, Heister, and Bangerth, GJI 2012) we first try to solve the Stokes system in every time step using a GMRES iteration with a poor but cheap preconditioner. By default, we try whether we can converge the GMRES solver in 30 such iterations before deciding that we need a better preconditioner. This is sufficient for simple problems with constant viscosity and we never need the second phase with the more expensive preconditioner. On the other hand, for more complex problems, and in particular for problems with strongly varying viscosity, the 30 cheap iterations don't actually do very much good and one might skip this part right away. In that case, this parameter can be set to zero, i.e., we immediately start with the better but more expensive preconditioner.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Output directory}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Output directory}


\index[prmindex]{Output directory}
\index[prmindexfull]{Output directory}
{\it Value:} output


{\it Default:} output


{\it Description:} The name of the directory into which all output files should be placed. This may be an absolute or a relative path.


{\it Possible values:} [DirectoryName]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Pressure normalization}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Pressure normalization}


\index[prmindex]{Pressure normalization}
\index[prmindexfull]{Pressure normalization}
{\it Value:} surface


{\it Default:} surface


{\it Description:} If and how to normalize the pressure after the solution step. This is necessary because depending on boundary conditions, in many cases the pressure is only determined by the model up to a constant. On the other hand, we often would like to have a well-determined pressure, for example for table lookups of material properties in models or for comparing solutions. If the given value is `surface', then normalization at the end of each time steps adds a constant value to the pressure in such a way that the average pressure at the surface of the domain is zero; the surface of the domain is determined by asking the geometry model whether a particular face of the geometry has a zero or small `depth'. If the value of this parameter is `volume' then the pressure is normalized so that the domain average is zero. If `no' is given, the no pressure normalization is performed.


{\it Possible values:} [Selection surface|volume|no ]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Resume computation}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Resume computation}


\index[prmindex]{Resume computation}
\index[prmindexfull]{Resume computation}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} A flag indicating whether the computation should be resumed from a previously saved state (if true) or start from scratch (if false). If auto is selected, models will be resumed if there is an existing checkpoint file, otherwise started from scratch.


{\it Possible values:} [Selection true|false|auto ]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Start time}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Start time}


\index[prmindex]{Start time}
\index[prmindexfull]{Start time}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} The start time of the simulation. Units: Years if the 'Use years in output instead of seconds' parameter is set; seconds otherwise.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Surface pressure}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Surface pressure}


\index[prmindex]{Surface pressure}
\index[prmindexfull]{Surface pressure}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} The mathematical equations that describe thermal convection only determine the pressure up to an arbitrary constant. On the other hand, for comparison and for looking up material parameters it is important that the pressure be normalized somehow. We do this by enforcing a particular average pressure value at the surface of the domain, where the geometry model determines where the surface is. This parameter describes what this average surface pressure value is supposed to be. By default, it is set to zero, but one may want to choose a different value for example for simulating only the volume of the mantle below the lithosphere, in which case the surface pressure should be the lithostatic pressure at the bottom of the lithosphere.

For more information, see the section in the manual that discusses the general mathematical model.


{\it Possible values:} [Double -1.79769e+308...1.79769e+308 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Temperature solver tolerance}

\index[prmindexfull]{Temperature solver tolerance}
{\it Value:} 1e-12


{\it Default:} 1e-12

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Timing output frequency}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Timing output frequency}


\index[prmindex]{Timing output frequency}
\index[prmindexfull]{Timing output frequency}
{\it Value:} 100


{\it Default:} 100


{\it Description:} How frequently in timesteps to output timing information. This is generally adjusted only for debugging and timing purposes. If the value is set to zero it will also output timing information at the initiation timesteps.


{\it Possible values:} [Integer range 0...2147483647 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Use conduction timestep}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Use conduction timestep}


\index[prmindex]{Use conduction timestep}
\index[prmindexfull]{Use conduction timestep}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} Mantle convection simulations are often focused on convection dominated systems. However, these codes can also be used to investigate systems where heat conduction plays a dominant role. This parameter indicates whether the simulator should also use heat conduction in determining the length of each time step.


{\it Possible values:} [Bool]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Use direct solver for Stokes system}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Use direct solver for Stokes system}


\index[prmindex]{Use direct solver for Stokes system}
\index[prmindexfull]{Use direct solver for Stokes system}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} If set to true the linear system for the Stokes equation will be solved using Trilinos klu, otherwise an iterative Schur complement solver is used. The direct solver is only efficient for small problems.


{\it Possible values:} [Bool]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Use years in output instead of seconds}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Use years in output instead of seconds}


\index[prmindex]{Use years in output instead of seconds}
\index[prmindexfull]{Use years in output instead of seconds}
{\it Value:} true


{\it Default:} true


{\it Description:} When computing results for mantle convection simulations, it is often difficult to judge the order of magnitude of results when they are stated in MKS units involving seconds. Rather, some kinds of results such as velocities are often stated in terms of meters per year (or, sometimes, centimeters per year). On the other hand, for non-dimensional computations, one wants results in their natural unit system as used inside the code. If this flag is set to 'true' conversion to years happens; if it is 'false', no such conversion happens. Note that when 'true', some input such as prescribed velocities should also use years instead of seconds.


{\it Possible values:} [Bool]

`initial profile': A model in which the adiabatic profile is calculated once at the start of the model run. The gravity is assumed to be in depth direction and the composition is evaluated at reference points, no lateral averaging is performed. All material parameters are used from the material model plugin.


{\it Possible values:} [Selection initial profile ]

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Model name}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Boundary composition model/Model name}


\index[prmindex]{Model name}
\index[prmindexfull]{Boundary composition model!Model name}
{\it Value:} unspecified


{\it Default:} unspecified


{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`ascii data': Implementation of a model in which the boundary composition is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of commentsif they begin with '\#', but one of these lines needs tocontain the number of grid points in each dimension asfor example '\# POINTS: 3 3'.The order of the data columns has to be 'x', 'composition1', 'composition2', etc. in a 2d model and 'x', 'y', 'composition1', 'composition2', etc., in a 3d model, according to the number of compositional fields, which means that there has to be a single column for every composition in the model.Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates.If you use a spherical model, then the data will still be handled as cartesian,however the assumed grid changes. 'x' will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, 'y' by the azimuth angle and 'z' by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is 'r', 'phi', 'theta' and not 'r', 'theta', 'phi', since this allows for dimension independent expressions. 

`box': A model in which the composition is chosen constant on all the sides of a box.

`box with lithosphere boundary indicators': A model in which the composition is chosen constant on all the sides of a box. Additional boundary indicators are added to the lithospheric parts of the vertical boundaries. This model is to be used with the 'Two Merged Boxes' Geometry Model.

`initial composition': A model in which the composition at the boundary is chosen to be the same as given in the initial conditions.

Because this class simply takes what the initial composition had described, this class can not know certain pieces of information such as the minimal and maximal composition on the boundary. For operations that require this, for example in postprocessing, this boundary composition model must therefore be told what the minimal and maximal values on the boundary are. This is done using parameters set in section ``Boundary composition model/Initial composition''.

`spherical constant': A model in which the composition is chosen constant on the inner and outer boundaries of a spherical shell or chunk. Parameters are read from subsection 'Spherical constant'.

\index[prmindex]{Model name}
\index[prmindexfull]{Boundary temperature model!Model name}
{\it Value:} box


{\it Default:} unspecified


{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`ascii data': Implementation of a model in which the boundary data is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of commentsif they begin with '\#', but one of these lines needs tocontain the number of grid points in each dimension asfor example '\# POINTS: 3 3'.The order of the data columns has to be 'x', 'Temperature [K]' in a 2d model and  'x', 'y', 'Temperature [K]' in a 3d model, which means that there has to be a single column containing the temperature. Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates.If you use a spherical model, then the data will still be handled as cartesian,however the assumed grid changes. 'x' will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, 'y' by the azimuth angle and 'z' by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is 'r', 'phi', 'theta' and not 'r', 'theta', 'phi', since this allows for dimension independent expressions. 

`box': A model in which the temperature is chosen constant on all the sides of a box.

`box with lithosphere boundary indicators': A model in which the temperature is chosen constant on all the sides of a box. Additional boundary indicators are added to the lithospheric parts of the vertical boundaries. This model is to be used with the 'Two Merged Boxes' Geometry Model.

`constant': A model in which the temperature is chosen constant on a given boundary indicator.  Parameters are read from the subsection 'Constant'.

`function': Implementation of a model in which the boundary temperature is given in terms of an explicit formula that is elaborated in the parameters in section ``Boundary temperature model|Function''. 

Since the symbol $t$ indicating time may appear in the formulas for the prescribed temperatures, it is interpreted as having units seconds unless the global input parameter ``Use years in output instead of seconds'' is set, in which case we interpret the formula expressions as having units year.

Because this class simply takes what the function calculates, this class can not know certain pieces of information such as the minimal and maximal temperature on the boundary. For operations that require this, for example in postprocessing, this boundary temperature model must therefore be told what the minimal and maximal values on the boundary are. This is done using parameters set in section ``Boundary temperature model/Initial temperature''.

The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

`initial temperature': A model in which the temperature at the boundary is chosen to be the same as given in the initial conditions.

Because this class simply takes what the initial temperature had described, this class can not know certain pieces of information such as the minimal and maximal temperature on the boundary. For operations that require this, for example in postprocessing, this boundary temperature model must therefore be told what the minimal and maximal values on the boundary are. This is done using parameters set in section ``Boundary temperature model/Initial temperature''.

`spherical constant': A model in which the temperature is chosen constant on the inner and outer boundaries of a spherical shell, ellipsoidal chunk or chunk. Parameters are read from subsection 'Spherical constant'.

{\it Description:} Sometimes it is convenient to use symbolic constants in the expression that describes the function, rather than having to use its numeric value everywhere the constant appears. These values can be defined using this parameter, in the form `var1=value1, var2=value2, ...'.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both `pi' and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)

{\it Description:} The formula that denotes the function you want to evaluate for particular values of the independent variables. This expression may contain any of the usual operations such as addition or multiplication, as well as all of the common functions such as `sin' or `cos'. In addition, it may contain expressions like `if(x>0, 1, -1)' where the expression evaluates to the second argument if the first argument is true, and to the third argument otherwise. For a full overview of possible expressions accepted see the documentation of the muparser library at http://muparser.beltoforion.de/.

{\it Description:} The name of the variables as they will be used in the function, separated by commas. By default, the names of variables at which the function will be evaluated is `x' (in 1d), `x,y' (in 2d) or `x,y,z' (in 3d) for spatial coordinates and `t' for time. You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

By default, the names of variables at which the function will be evaluated is `x' (in 1d), `x,y' (in 2d) or `x,y,z' (in 3d) for spatial coordinates and `t' for time. You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

`ascii data': Implementation of a model in which the initial composition is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of commentsif they begin with '\#', but one of these lines needs tocontain the number of grid points in each dimension asfor example '\# POINTS: 3 3'.The order of the data columns has to be 'x', 'y', 'composition1', 'composition2', etc. in a 2d model and 'x', 'y', 'z', 'composition1', 'composition2', etc. in a 3d model, according to the number of compositional fields, which means that there has to be a single column for every composition in the model.Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second and the third at last in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates.If you use a spherical model, then the data will still be handled as cartesian,however the assumed grid changes. 'x' will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, 'y' by the azimuth angle and 'z' by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is 'r', 'phi', 'theta' and not 'r', 'theta', 'phi', since this allows for dimension independent expressions. 

`function': Specify the composition in terms of an explicit formula. The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

\index[prmindexfull]{Discretization!Use locally conservative discretization}
{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} Whether to use a Stokes discretization that is locally conservative at the expense of a larger number of degrees of freedom (true), or to go with a cheaper discretization that does not locally conserve mass, although it is globally conservative (false).

When using a locally conservative discretization, the finite element space for the pressure is discontinuous between cells and is the polynomial space $P_ {-q}$ of polynomials of degree $q$ in each variable separately. Here, $q$ is one less than the value given in the parameter ``Stokes velocity polynomial degree''. As a consequence of choosing this element, it can be shown if the medium is considered incompressible that the computed discrete velocity field $\mathbf u_h$ satisfies the property $\int_ {\partial K} \mathbf u_h \cdot \mathbf n = 0$ for every cell $K$, i.e., for each cell inflow and outflow exactly balance each other as one would expect for an incompressible medium. In other words, the velocity field is locally conservative.

On the other hand, if this parameter is set to ``false'', then the finite element space is chosen as $Q_q$. This choice does not yield the local conservation property but has the advantage of requiring fewer degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the error is generally smaller with this choice.

For an in-depth discussion of these issues and a quantitative evaluation of the different choices, see \cite {KHB12} .

\index[prmindex]{Use artificial viscosity smoothing}

{\it Value:} false


{\it Default:} false


{\it Description:} If set to false, the artificial viscosity of a cell is computed andis computed on every cell separately as discussed in \cite{KHB12}. If set to true, the maximum of the artificial viscosity in the cell as well as the neighbors of the cell is computed and used instead.

{\it Value:} 2


{\it Default:} 2


{\it Description:} The exponent $\alpha$ in the entropy viscosity stabilization. Valid options are 1 or 2. The recommended setting is 2. (This parameter does not correspond to any variable in the 2012 GJI paper by Kronbichler, Heister and Bangerth that describes ASPECT. Rather, the paper always uses 2 as the exponent in the definition of the entropy, following eq. (15).).Units: None.

{\it Value:} 0.078


{\it Default:} 0.078


{\it Description:} The $\beta$ factor in the artificial viscosity stabilization. An appropriate value for 2d is 0.078 and 0.117 for 3d. (For historical reasons, the name used here is different from the one used in the 2012 GJI paper by Kronbichler, Heister and Bangerth that describes ASPECT. This parameter corresponds to the factor $\alpha_\text {max}$ in the formulas following equation (15) of the paper. After further experiments, we have also chosen to use a different value than described there: It can be chosen as stated there for uniformly refined meshes, but it needs to be chosen larger if the mesh has cells that are not squares or cubes.) Units: None.

\phantomsection\label{parameters:Free surface/Additional tangential mesh velocity boundary indicators}


\index[prmindex]{Additional tangential mesh velocity boundary indicators}
\index[prmindexfull]{Free surface!Additional tangential mesh velocity boundary indicators}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A comma separated list of names denoting those boundaries where there the mesh is allowed to move tangential to the boundary. All tangential mesh movements along those boundaries that have tangential material velocity boundary conditions are allowed by default, this parameters allows to generate mesh movements along other boundaries that are open, or have prescribed material velocities or tractions.

The names of the boundaries listed here can either be numbers (in which case they correspond to the numerical boundary indicators assigned by the geometry object), or they can correspond to any of the symbolic names the geometry object may have provided for each part of the boundary. You may want to compare this with the documentation of the geometry model you use in your model.


{\it Possible values:} [List list of [Anything] of length 0...4294967295 (inclusive)]

\index[prmindex]{Free surface stabilization theta}
\index[prmindexfull]{Free surface!Free surface stabilization theta}
{\it Value:} 0.5


{\it Default:} 0.5


{\it Description:} Theta parameter described in Kaus et. al. 2010. An unstabilized free surface can overshoot its equilibrium position quite easily and generate unphysical results.  One solution is to use a quasi-implicit correction term to the forces near the free surface.  This parameter describes how much the free surface is stabilized with this term, where zero is no stabilization, and one is fully implicit.


{\it Possible values:} [Double 0...1 (inclusive)]
\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt Surface velocity projection}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Free surface/Surface velocity projection}


\index[prmindex]{Surface velocity projection}
\index[prmindexfull]{Free surface!Surface velocity projection}
{\it Value:} normal


{\it Default:} normal


{\it Description:} After each time step the free surface must be advected in the direction of the velocity field. Mass conservation requires that the mesh velocity is in the normal direction of the surface. However, for steep topography or large curvature, advection in the normal direction can become ill-conditioned, and instabilities in the mesh can form. Projection of the mesh velocity onto the local vertical direction can preserve the mesh quality better, but at the cost of slightly poorer mass conservation of the domain.

\subsection{Parameters in section \tt Geometry model}

\phantomsection\label{parameters:Geometry model/Model name}


\index[prmindex]{Model name}
\index[prmindexfull]{Geometry model!Model name}
{\it Value:} box


{\it Default:} unspecified


{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`box': A box geometry parallel to the coordinate directions. The extent of the box in each coordinate direction is set in the parameter file. The box geometry labels its 2*dim sides as follows: in 2d, boundary indicators 0 through 3 denote the left, right, bottom and top boundaries; in 3d, boundary indicators 0 through 5 indicate left, right, front, back, bottom and top boundaries (see also the documentation of the deal.II class ``GeometryInfo''). You can also use symbolic names ``left'', ``right'', etc., to refer to these boundaries in input files.

`box with lithosphere boundary indicators': A box geometry parallel to the coordinate directions. The extent of the box in each coordinate direction is set in the parameter file. This geometry model labels its sides with 2*dim+2*(dim-1) boundary indicators: in 2d, boundary indicators 0 through 3 denote the left, right, bottom and top boundaries, while indicators4 and 5 denote the upper part of the left and right vertical boundary, respectively. In 3d, boundary indicators 0 through 5 indicate left, right, front, back, bottom and top boundaries (see also the documentation of the deal.II class ``GeometryInfo''), while indicators 6, 7, 8 and 9 denote the left, rigth, front and back upper parts of the vertical boundaries, respectively. You can also use symbolic names ``left'', ``right'', ``left lithosphere'', etc., to refer to these boundaries in input files.

Note that for a given ``Global refinement level'' and no user-specified ``Repetitions'', the lithosphere part of the mesh will be more refined. 

The additional boundary indicators for the lithosphere allow for selecting boundary conditions for the lithosphere different from those for the underlying mantle. An example application of this geometry is to prescribe a velocity on the lithospheric plates, but use open boundary conditions underneath. 

`chunk': A geometry which can be described as a chunk of a spherical shell, bounded by lines of longitude, latitude and radius. The minimum and maximum longitude, (latitude) and depth of the chunk is set in the parameter file. The chunk geometry labels its 2*dim sides as follows: ``west'' and ``east'': minimum and maximum longitude, ``south'' and ``north'': minimum and maximum latitude, ``inner'' and ``outer'': minimum and maximum radii. Names in the parameter files are as follows: Chunk (minimum || maximum) (longitude || latitude): edges of geographical quadrangle (in degrees)Chunk (inner || outer) radius: Radii at bottom and top of chunk(Longitude || Latitude || Radius) repetitions: number of cells in each coordinate direction.

`ellipsoidal chunk': A 3D chunk geometry that accounts for Earth's ellipticity (default assuming the WGS84 ellipsoid definition) which can be defined in non-coordinate directions. In the description of the ellipsoidal chunk, two of the ellipsoidal axes have the same length so that there is only a semi-major axis and a semi-minor axis. The user has two options for creating an ellipsoidal chunk geometry: 1) by defining two opposing points (SW and NE or NW and SE) a coordinate parallel ellipsoidal chunk geometry will be created. 2) by defining three points a non-coordinate parallel ellipsoidal chunk will be created. The points are defined in the input file by longitude:latitude. It is also possible to define additional subdivisions of the mesh in each direction. Faces of the model are defined as 0, west; 1,east; 2, south; 3, north; 4, inner; 5, outer. 

`sphere': Geometry model for sphere with a user specified radius. This geometry has only a single boundary, so the only valid boundary indicator to specify in the input file is ``0''. It can also be referenced by the symbolic name ``surface'' in input files.

`spherical shell': A geometry representing a spherical shell or a piece of it. Inner and outer radii are read from the parameter file in subsection 'Spherical shell'.

The model assigns boundary indicators as follows: In 2d, inner and outer boundaries get boundary indicators zero and one, and if the opening angle set in the input file is less than 360, then left and right boundaries are assigned indicators two and three. These boundaries can also be referenced using the symbolic names 'inner', 'outer' and (if applicable) 'left', 'right'.

In 3d, inner and outer indicators are treated as in 2d. If the opening angle is chosen as 90 degrees, i.e., the domain is the intersection of a spherical shell and the first octant, then indicator 2 is at the face $x=0$, 3 at $y=0$, and 4 at $z=0$. These last three boundaries can then also be referred to as 'east', 'west' and 'south' symbolically in input files.

{\it Description:} The number of cells in circumferential direction that are created in the coarse mesh in 2d. If zero, this number is chosen automatically in a way that produces meshes in which cells have a reasonable aspect ratio for models in which the depth of the mantle is roughly that of the Earth.

In 3d, the number of cells is computed differently and does not have an easy interpretation. Valid values for this parameter in 3d are 0 (let this class choose), 6, 12 and 96. Other possible values may be discussed in the documentation of the deal.II function GridGenerator::hyper\_shell. The parameter is best left at its default in 3d.

`function': Gravity is given in terms of an explicit formula that is elaborated in the parameters in section ``Gravity model|Function''. The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

`radial constant': A gravity model in which the gravity direction is radially inward and at constant magnitude. The magnitude is read from the parameter file in subsection 'Radial constant'.

`radial earth-like': A gravity model in which the gravity direction is radially inward and with a magnitude that matches that of the earth at the core-mantle boundary as well as at the surface and in between is physically correct under the assumption of a constant density.

`radial linear': A gravity model which is radially inward, where the magnitudedecreases linearly with depth down to zero at the maximal depth the geometry returns, as you would get with a constantdensity spherical domain. (Note that this would be for a full sphere, not a spherical shell.) The magnitude of gravity at the surface is read from the input file in a section ``Gravity model/Radial linear''.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both `pi' and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)

This expression may contain any of the usual operations such as addition or multiplication, as well as all of the common functions such as `sin' or `cos'. In addition, it may contain expressions like `if(x>0, 1, -1)' where the expression evaluates to the second argument if the first argument is true, and to the third argument otherwise.

You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

`S40RTS perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following the S20RTS or S40RTS shear wave velocity model by Ritsema and others, which can be downloaded here \url{http://www.earth.lsa.umich.edu/~jritsema/research.html}. Information on the vs model can be found in Ritsema, J., Deuss, A., van Heijst, H.J. \& Woodhouse, J.H., 2011. S40RTS: a degree-40 shear-velocity model for the mantle from new Rayleigh wave dispersion, teleseismic traveltime and normal-mode splitting function measurements, Geophys. J. Int. 184, 1223-1236. The scaling between the shear wave perturbation and the temperature perturbation can be set by the user with the 'vs to density scaling' parameter and the 'Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling' parameter. The scaling is as follows: $\delta ln \rho (r,\theta,\phi) = \xi \cdot \delta ln v_s(r,\theta, \phi)$ and $\delta T(r,\theta,\phi) = - \frac{1}{\alpha} \delta ln \rho(r,\theta,\phi)$. $\xi$ is the 'vs to density scaling' parameter and $\alpha$ is the 'Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling' parameter. The temperature perturbation is added to an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model). If a depth is specified in 'Remove temperature heterogeneity down to specified depth', there is no temperature perturbation prescribed down to that depth.

`SAVANI perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following the SAVANI shear wave velocity model by Auer and others, which can be downloaded here \url{http://n.ethz.ch/~auerl/savani.tar.bz2}. Information on the vs model can be found in Auer, L., Boschi, L., Becker, T.W., Nissen-Meyer, T. \& Giardini, D., 2014. Savani:A variable resolution whole‐mantle model of anisotropic shear velocityvariations based on multiple data sets. Journal of GeophysicalResearch: Solid Earth 119.4 (2014): 3006-3034. The scaling between the shear wave perturbation and the temperature perturbation can be set by the user with the 'vs to density scaling' parameter and the 'Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling' parameter. The scaling is as follows: $\delta ln \rho (r,\theta,\phi) = \xi \cdot \delta ln v_s(r,\theta, \phi)$ and $\delta T(r,\theta,\phi) = - \frac{1}{\alpha} \delta ln \rho(r,\theta,\phi)$. $\xi$ is the 'vs to density scaling' parameter and $\alpha$ is the 'Thermal expansion coefficient in initial temperature scaling' parameter. The temperature perturbation is added to an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model).

`adiabatic': Temperature is prescribed as an adiabatic profile with upper and lower thermal boundary layers, whose ages are given as input parameters.

`ascii data': Implementation of a model in which the initial temperature is derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of commentsif they begin with '\#', but one of these lines needs tocontain the number of grid points in each dimension asfor example '\# POINTS: 3 3'.The order of the data columns has to be 'x', 'y', 'Temperature [K]' in a 2d model and  'x', 'y', 'z', 'Temperature [K]' in a 3d model, which means that there has to be a single column containing the temperature. Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second and the third at last in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates.If you use a spherical model, then the data will still be handled as cartesian,however the assumed grid changes. 'x' will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, 'y' by the azimuth angle and 'z' by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is 'r', 'phi', 'theta' and not 'r', 'theta', 'phi', since this allows for dimension independent expressions. 

`function': Specify the initial temperature in terms of an explicit formula. The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

`harmonic perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following a harmonic function (spherical harmonic or sine depending on geometry and dimension) in lateral and radial direction from an otherwise constant temperature (incompressible model) or adiabatic reference profile (compressible model).

`inclusion shape perturbation': An initial temperature field in which there is an inclusion in a constant-temperature box field. The size, shape, gradient, position, and temperature of the inclusion are defined by parameters.

`mandelbox': Fractal-shaped temperature field.

`perturbed box': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed slightly from an otherwise constant value equal to one. The perturbation is chosen in such a way that the initial temperature is constant to one along the entire boundary.

`polar box': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed slightly from an otherwise constant value equal to one. The perturbation is such that there are two poles on opposing corners of the box. 

`solidus': This is a temperature initial condition that starts the model close to solidus, it also contains a user defined lithoshpere thickness and with perturbations  in both lithosphere thickness and temperature based on spherical harmonic functions. It was used as the initial condition of early Mars after the freezing of the magma ocean, using the solidus from Parmentier et al., Melt-solid segregation, Fractional magma ocean solidification, and implications for longterm planetary evolution. Luna and Planetary Science, 2007.

`spherical gaussian perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed by a single Gaussian added to an otherwise spherically symmetric state. Additional parameters are read from the parameter file in subsection 'Spherical gaussian perturbation'.

`spherical hexagonal perturbation': An initial temperature field in which the temperature is perturbed following an $N$-fold pattern in a specified direction from an otherwise spherically symmetric state. The class's name comes from previous versions when the only option was $N=6$.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both `pi' and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)

You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression.

For example if you specify a depth of 660km, but your closest spherical depth layers are only at 500km and 750km (due to a coarse resolution) it will only zero out heterogeneities down to 500km. Similar caution has to be taken when using adaptive meshing.

The process of averaging, and where it may be used, is discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:sinker-with-averaging}.

{\it Default:} unspecified


{\it Description:} The name of the material model to be used in this simulation. There are many material models you can choose from, as listed below. They generally fall into two category: (i) models that implement a particular case of material behavior, (ii) models that modify other models in some way. We sometimes call the latter ``compositing models''. An example of a compositing model is the ``depth dependent'' model below in that it takes another, freely choosable model as its base and then modifies that model's output in some way.

You can select one of the following models:

`Morency and Doin': An implementation of the visco-plastic rheology described by (Morency and Doin, 2004). Compositional fields can each be assigned individual activation energies, reference densities, thermal expansivities, and stress exponents. The effective viscosity is defined as \[v_{eff} = \left(\frac{1}{v_{eff}^v}+\frac{1}{v_{eff}^p}\right)^{-1}\] where \[v_{eff}^v = B \left(\frac{\dot{\epsilon}}{\dot{\epsilon}_{ref}} \right)^{-1+1/n_v} exp\left(\frac{E_a +V_a \rho_m g z}{n_v R T}\right) \] \[v_{eff}^p = (\tau_0 + \gamma \rho_m g z) \left( \frac{\dot{\epsilon}^{-1+1/n_p}} {\dot{\epsilon}_{ref}^{1/n_p}} \right) \] where $B$ is a scaling constant; $\dot{\epsilon}$ is defined as the quadratic sum of the second invariant of the strain rate tensor and a minimum strain rate, $\dot{\epsilon}_0$; $\dot{\epsilon}_{ref}$ is a reference strain rate; $n_v$, and $n_p$ are stress exponents; $E_a$ is the activation energy; $V_a$ is the activation volume; $\rho_m$ is the mantle density; $R$ is the gas constant; $T$ is temperature; $\tau_0$ is the cohestive strength of rocks at the surface; $\gamma$ is a coefficient of yield stress increase with depth; and $z$ is depth. 

 Note: (Morency and Doin, 2004) defines the second invariant of the strain rate in a nonstandard way. The formulation in the paper is given as $\epsilon_{II} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} (\epsilon_{11}^2 + \epsilon_{12}^2)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the strain rate tensor. For consistency, that is also the formulation implemented in this material model. 

 Morency, C., and M‐P. Doin. "Numerical simulations of the mantle lithosphere delamination." Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth (1978–2012) 109.B3 (2004). 

 The value for the components of this formula and additional parameters are read from the parameter file in subsection 'Material model/Morency and Doin'.

`Steinberger': This material model looks up the viscosity from the tables that correspond to the paper of Steinberger and Calderwood 2006 (``Models of large-scale viscous flow in the Earth's mantle with constraints from mineral physics and surface observations'', Geophys. J. Int., 167, 1461-1481, \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03131.x}) and material data from a database generated by the thermodynamics code \texttt{Perplex}, see \url{http://www.perplex.ethz.ch/}. The default example data builds upon the thermodynamic database by Stixrude 2011 and assumes a pyrolitic composition by Ringwood 1988 but is easily replaceable by other data files. 

`averaging': The ``averaging'' Material model applies an averaging of the quadrature points within a cell. The values to average are supplied by any of the other available material models. In other words, it is a ``compositing material model''. Parameters related to the average model are read from a subsection ``Material model/Averaging''. 

The user must specify a ``Base model'' from which material properties are derived. Furthermore an averaging operation must be selected, where the Choice should be from the list none|arithmetic average|harmonic average|geometric average|pick largest|log average|NWD arithmetic average|NWD harmonic average|NWD geometric average. 

NWD stands for Normalized Weighed Distance. The models with this in front of their name work with a weighed average, which means each quadrature point requires an individual weight. The weight is determined by the distance, where the exact relation is determined by a bell shaped curve. A bell shaped curve is a continuous function which is one at it's maximum and exactly zero at and beyond it's limit. This bell shaped curve is spanned around each quadrature point to determine the weighting map for each quadrature point. The used bell shape comes from Lucy (1977). The distance is normalized so the largest distance becomes one. This means that if variable ''Bell shape limit'' is exactly one, the farthest quadrature point is just on the limit and it's weight will be exactly zero. In this plugin it is not implemented as larger and equal than the limit, but larger than, to ensure the the quadrature point at distance zero is always included.

`composition reaction': A material model that behaves in the same way as the simple material model, but includes two compositional fields and a reaction between them. Above a depth given in the input file, the first fields gets converted to the second field. 

`depth dependent': The ``depth dependent'' Material model applies a depth-dependent scaling to any of the other available material models. In other words, it is a ``compositing material model''.

Parameters related to the depth dependent model are read from a subsection ``Material model/Depth dependent model''. The user must specify a ``Base model'' from which material properties are derived. Currently the depth dependent model only allows depth dependence of viscosity - other material properties are taken from the ``Base model''. Viscosity $\eta$ at depth $z$ is calculated according to:\begin{equation}\eta(z,p,T,X,...) = \eta(z) \eta_b(p,T,X,..)/\eta_{rb}\end{equation}where $\eta(z)$ is the the depth-dependence specified by the depth dependent model, $\eta_b(p,T,X,...)$ is the viscosity calculated from the base model, and $\eta_{rb}$ is the reference viscosity of the ``Base model''. In addition to the specification of the ``Base model'', the user must specify the method to be used to calculate the depth-dependent viscosity $\eta(z)$ as ``Material model/Depth dependent model/Depth dependence method'', which can be chosen among ``None|Function|File|List''. Each method and the associated parameters are as follows:

``Function'': read a user-specified parsed function from the input file in a subsection ``Material model/Depth dependent model/Viscosity depth function''. By default, this function is uniformly equal to 1.0e21. Specifying a function that returns a value less than or equal to 0.0 anywhere in the model domain will produce an error. 

``File'': read a user-specified file containing viscosity values at specified depths. The file containing depth-dependent viscosities is read from a directory specified by the user as ``Material model/Depth dependent model/Data directory'', from a file with name specified as ``Material model/Depth dependent model/Viscosity depth file''. The format of this file is ascii text and contains two columns with one header line:

example Viscosity depth file:\\Depth (m)    Viscosity (Pa-s)\\0.0000000e+00     1.0000000e+21\\6.7000000e+05     1.0000000e+22\\

Viscosity is interpolated from this file using linear interpolation. ``None'': no depth-dependence. Viscosity is taken directly from ``Base model''

``List:'': read a comma-separated list of depth values corresponding to the maximum depths of layers having constant depth-dependence $\eta(z)$. The layers must be specified in order of increasing depth, and the last layer in the list must have a depth greater than or equal to the maximal depth of the model. The list of layer depths is specified as ``Material model/Depth dependent model/Depth list'' and the corresponding list of layer viscosities is specified as ``Material model/Depth dependent model/Viscosity list''

`diffusion dislocation':  An implementation of a viscous rheology including diffusion and dislocation creep. Compositional fields can each be assigned individual activation energies, reference densities, thermal expansivities, and stress exponents. The effective viscosity is defined as 

 \[v_\text{eff} = \left(\frac{1}{v_\text{eff}^\text{diff}}+ \frac{1}{v_\text{eff}^\text{dis}}\right)^{-1}\] where \[v_\text{i} = 0.5 * A^{-\frac{1}{n_i}} d^\frac{m_i}{n_i} \dot{\varepsilon_i}^{\frac{1-n_i}{n_i}} \exp\left(\frac{E_i^* + PV_i^*}{n_iRT}\right)\] 

 where $d$ is grain size, $i$ corresponds to diffusion or dislocation creep, $\dot{\varepsilon}$ is the square root of the second invariant of the strain rate tensor, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature,  and $P$ is pressure. $A_i$ are prefactors, $n_i$ and $m_i$ are stress and grain size exponents $E_i$ are the activation energies and $V_i$ are the activation volumes. 

 The ratio of diffusion to dislocation strain rate is found by Newton's method, iterating to find the stress which satisfies the above equations. The value for the components of this formula and additional parameters are read from the parameter file in subsection 'Material model/DiffusionDislocation'.

`drucker prager': A material model that has constant values for all coefficients but the density and viscosity. The defaults for all coefficients are chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct for Earth's mantle. All of the values that define this model are read from a section ``Material model/Drucker Prager'' in the input file, see Section~\ref{parameters:Material_model/Drucker Prager}.Note that the model does not take into account any dependencies of material properties on compositional fields. 

The viscosity is computed according to the Drucker Prager frictional plasticity criterion (non-associative) based on a user-defined internal friction angle $\phi$ and cohesion $C$. In 3D:  $\sigma_y = \frac{6 C \cos(\phi)}{\sqrt(3) (3+\sin(\phi))} + \frac{2 P \sin(\phi)}{\sqrt(3) (3+\sin(\phi))}$, where $P$ is the pressure. See for example Zienkiewicz, O. C., Humpheson, C. and Lewis, R. W. (1975), G\'{e}otechnique 25, No. 4, 671-689. With this formulation we circumscribe instead of inscribe the Mohr Coulomb yield surface. In 2D the Drucker Prager yield surface is the same as the Mohr Coulomb surface:  $\sigma_y = P \sin(\phi) + C \cos(\phi)$. Note that in 2D for $\phi=0$, these criteria revert to the von Mises criterion (no pressure dependence). See for example Thieulot, C. (2011), PEPI 188, 47-68. 

Note that we enforce the pressure to be positive to prevent negative yield strengths and viscosities. 

We then use the computed yield strength to scale back the viscosity on to the yield surface using the Viscosity Rescaling Method described in Kachanov, L. M. (2004), Fundamentals of the Theory of Plasticity, Dover Publications, Inc. (Not Radial Return.)A similar implementation can be found in GALE (https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/gale/gale-manual.pdf). 

To avoid numerically unfavourably large (or even negative) viscosity ranges, we cut off the viscosity with a user-defined minimum and maximum viscosity: $\eta_eff = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\eta_min + \eta}+ \frac{1}{\eta_max}}$. 

Note that this model uses the formulation that assumes an incompressible medium despite the fact that the density follows the law $\rho(T)=\rho_0(1-\beta(T-T_{\text{ref}}))$. 

`latent heat': A material model that includes phase transitions and the possibility that latent heat is released or absorbed when material crosses one of the phase transitions of up to two different materials (compositional fields). This model implements a standard approximation of the latent heat terms following Christensen \& Yuen, 1985. The change of entropy is calculated as $Delta S = \gamma \frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho^2}$ with the Clapeyron slope $\gamma$ and the density change $\Delta\rho$ of the phase transition being input parameters. The model employs an analytic phase function in the form $X=0.5 \left( 1 + \tanh \left( \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta p_0} \right) \right)$ with $\Delta p = p - p_{transition} - \gamma \left( T - T_{transition} \right)$ and $\Delta p_0$ being the pressure difference over the width of the phase transition (specified as input parameter).

`latent heat melt': A material model that includes the latent heat of melting for two materials: peridotite and pyroxenite. The melting model for peridotite is taken from Katz et al., 2003 (A new parameterization of hydrous mantle melting) and the one for pyroxenite from Sobolev et al., 2011 (Linking mantle plumes, large igneous provinces and environmental catastrophes). The model assumes a constant entropy change for melting 100\% of the material, which can be specified in the input file. The partial derivatives of entropy with respect to temperature and pressure required for calculating the latent heat consumption are then calculated as product of this constant entropy change, and the respective derivative of the function the describes the melt fraction. This is linearly averaged with respect to the fractions of the two materials present. If no compositional fields are specified in the input file, the model assumes that the material is peridotite. If compositional fields are specified, the model assumes that the first compositional field is the fraction of pyroxenite and the rest of the material is peridotite. 

Otherwise, this material model has a temperature- and pressure-dependent density and viscosity and the density and thermal expansivity depend on the melt fraction present. It is possible to extent this model to include a melt fraction dependence of all the material parameters by calling the function melt\_fraction in the calculation of the respective parameter. However, melt and solid move with the same velocity and melt extraction is not taken into account (batch melting). 

`multicomponent': This model is for use with an arbitrary number of compositional fields, where each field represents a rock type which can have completely different properties from the others. However, each rock type itself has constant material properties.  The value of the  compositional field is interpreed as a volume fraction. If the sum of the fields is greater than one, they are renormalized.  If it is less than one, material properties  for ``background mantle'' make up the rest. When more than one field is present, the material properties are averaged arithmetically.  An exception is the viscosity, where the averaging should make more of a difference.  For this, the user selects between arithmetic, harmonic, geometric, or maximum composition averaging.

`simple': A material model that has constant values for all coefficients but the density and viscosity. The defaults for all coefficients are chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct for Earth's mantle. All of the values that define this model are read from a section ``Material model/Simple model'' in the input file, see Section~\ref{parameters:Material_20model/Simple_20model}.

This model uses the following set of equations for the two coefficients that are non-constant: \begin{align}  \eta(p,T,\mathfrak c) &= \tau(T) \zeta(\mathfrak c) \eta_0, \\  \rho(p,T,\mathfrak c) &= \left(1-\alpha (T-T_0)\right)\rho_0 + \Delta\rho \; c_0,\end{align}where $c_0$ is the first component of the compositional vector $\mathfrak c$ if the model uses compositional fields, or zero otherwise. 

The temperature pre-factor for the viscosity formula above is defined as \begin{align}  \tau(T) &= H\left(e^{-\beta (T-T_0)/T_0}\right),  \qquad\qquad H(x) = \begin{cases}                            10^{-2} & \text{if}\; x<10^{-2}, \\                            x & \text{if}\; 10^{-2}\le x \le 10^2, \\                            10^{2} & \text{if}\; x>10^{2}, \\                         \end{cases}\end{align} where $\beta$ corresponds to the input parameter ``Thermal viscosity exponent'' and $T_0$ to the parameter ``Reference temperature''. If you set $T_0=0$ in the input file, the thermal pre-factor $\tau(T)=1$.

The compositional pre-factor for the viscosity is defined as \begin{align}  \zeta(\mathfrak c) &= \xi^{c_0}\end{align} if the model has compositional fields and equals one otherwise. $\xi$ corresponds to the parameter ``Composition viscosity prefactor'' in the input file.

Finally, in the formula for the density, $\alpha$ corresponds to the ``Thermal expansion coefficient'' and $\Delta\rho$ corresponds to the parameter ``Density differential for compositional field 1''.

Note that this model uses the formulation that assumes an incompressible medium despite the fact that the density follows the law $\rho(T)=\rho_0(1-\alpha(T-T_{\text{ref}}))$. 

\note{Despite its name, this material model is not exactly ``simple'', as indicated by the formulas above. While it was originally intended to be simple, it has over time acquired all sorts of temperature and compositional dependencies that weren't initially intended. Consequently, there is now a ``simpler'' material model that now fills the role the current model was originally intended to fill.}

`simple compressible': A material model that has constant values for all coefficients but the density. The defaults for all coefficients are chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct for Earth's mantle. All of the values that define this model are read from a section ``Material model/Simple compressible model'' in the input file, see Section~\ref{parameters:Material_20model/Simple_20compressible_20model}.

This model uses the following equations for the density: \begin{align}  \rho(p,T) = \rho_0              \left(1-\alpha (T-T_a)\right)               \exp{\beta (P-P_0))}\end{align}

`simpler': A material model that has constant values except for density, which depends linearly on temperature: \begin{align}  \rho(p,T) &= \left(1-\alpha (T-T_0)\right)\rho_0.\end{align}

\note{This material model fills the role the ``simple'' material model was originally intended to fill, before the latter acquired all sorts of complicated temperature and compositional dependencies.}

You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

{\it Description:} If compositional fields are used, then one would frequently want to make the density depend on these fields.

If there are compositional fields, then the density only depends on the first one in such a way that the density has an additional term of the kind $+\Delta \rho \; c_1(\mathbf x)$.

This is done using the method described by the ``Refinement criteria merge operation'' parameter which can either operate on the raw refinement indicators returned by each strategy (i.e., dimensional quantities) or using normalized values where the indicators of each strategy are first normalized to the interval $[0,1]$ (which also makes them non-dimensional).

\begin{itemize}

{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A list of scaling factors by which every individual refinement criterion will be multiplied by. If only a single refinement criterion is selected (using the ``Strategy'' parameter, then this parameter has no particular meaning. On the other hand, if multiple criteria are chosen, then these factors are used to weigh the various indicators relative to each other. 

If ``Normalize individual refinement criteria'' is set to true, then the criteria will first be normalized to the interval $[0,1]$ and then multiplied by the factors specified here. You will likely want to choose the factors to be not too far from 1 in that case, say between 1 and 10, to avoid essentially disabling those criteria with small weights. On the other hand, if the criteria are not normalized to $[0,1]$ using the parameter mentioned above, then the factors you specify here need to take into account the relative numerical size of refinement indicators (which in that case carry physical units).

You can experimentally play with these scaling factors by choosing to output the refinement indicators into the graphical output of a run.

If the list of indicators given in this parameter is empty, then this indicates that they should all be chosen equal to one. If the list is not empty then it needs to have as many entries as there are indicators chosen in the ``Strategy'' parameter.

{\it Value:} thermal energy density

{\it Description:} A comma separated list of mesh refinement criteria that will be run whenever mesh refinement is required. The results of each of these criteria, i.e., the refinement indicators they produce for all the cells of the mesh will then be normalized to a range between zero and one and the results of different criteria will then be merged through the operation selected in this section.

The following criteria are available:

`boundary': A class that implements a mesh refinement criterion which always flags all cells on specified boundaries for refinement. This is useful to provide high accuracy for processes at or close to the edge of the model domain.

To use this refinement criterion, you may want to combine it with other refinement criteria, setting the 'Normalize individual refinement criteria' flag and using the 'max' setting for 'Refinement criteria merge operation'.

`composition': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the compositional fields. If there is more than one compositional field, then it simply takes the sum of the indicators computed from each of the compositional field.

`density': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from a field that describes the spatial variability of the density, $\rho$. Because this quantity may not be a continuous function ($\rho$ and $C_p$ may be discontinuous functions along discontinuities in the medium, for example due to phase changes), we approximate the gradient of this quantity to refine the mesh. The error indicator defined here takes the magnitude of the approximate gradient and scales it by $h_K^{1+d/2}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of each cell and $d$ is the dimension. This scaling ensures that the error indicators converge to zero as $h_K\rightarrow 0$ even if the energy density is discontinuous, since the gradient of a discontinuous function grows like $1/h_K$.

`maximum refinement function': A mesh refinement criterion that ensures a maximum refinement level described by an explicit formula with the depth or position as argument. Which coordinate representation is used is determined by an input parameter. Whatever the coordinate system chosen, the function you provide in the input file will by default depend on variables 'x', 'y' and 'z' (if in 3d). However, the meaning of these symbols depends on the coordinate system. In the Cartesian coordinate system, they simply refer to their natural meaning. If you have selected 'depth' for the coordinate system, then 'x' refers to the depth variable and 'y' and 'z' will simply always be zero. If you have selected a spherical coordinate system, then 'x' will refer to the radial distance of the point to the origin, 'y' to the azimuth angle and 'z' to the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is r,phi,theta and not r,theta,phi, since this allows for dimension independent expressions. After evaluating the function, its values are rounded to the nearest integer.

The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

`minimum refinement function': A mesh refinement criterion that ensures a minimum refinement level described by an explicit formula with the depth or position as argument. Which coordinate representation is used is determined by an input parameter. Whatever the coordinate system chosen, the function you provide in the input file will by default depend on variables 'x', 'y' and 'z' (if in 3d). However, the meaning of these symbols depends on the coordinate system. In the Cartesian coordinate system, they simply refer to their natural meaning. If you have selected 'depth' for the coordinate system, then 'x' refers to the depth variable and 'y' and 'z' will simply always be zero. If you have selected a spherical coordinate system, then 'x' will refer to the radial distance of the point to the origin, 'y' to the azimuth angle and 'z' to the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is r,phi,theta and not r,theta,phi, since this allows for dimension independent expressions. After evaluating the function, its values are rounded to the nearest integer.

The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

`nonadiabatic temperature': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the excess temperature(difference between temperature and adiabatic temperature.

`particle density': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators that equal the areal (in 2d) or volumetric (in 3d) density of particles in this cell. This plugin is useful for models with inhomogeneous particle density, e.g. when tracking an initial interface with a high particle density, or when the spatial particle density denotes the region of interest. Additionally, this plugin tends to balance the computational load between processes in parallel computations, because the particle number per cell is more similar.

`slope': A class that implements a mesh refinement criterion intended for use with a free surface. It calculates a local slope based on the angle between the surface normal and the local gravity vector. Cells with larger angles are marked for refinement.

To use this refinement criterion, you may want to combine it with other refinement criteria, setting the 'Normalize individual refinement criteria' flag and using the 'max' setting for 'Refinement criteria merge operation'.

`strain rate': A mesh refinement criterion that computes therefinement indicators equal to the strain rate norm computed at the center of the elements.

`temperature': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the temperature field.

`thermal energy density': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from a field that describes the spatial variability of the thermal energy density, $\rho C_p T$. Because this quantity may not be a continuous function ($\rho$ and $C_p$ may be discontinuous functions along discontinuities in the medium, for example due to phase changes), we approximate the gradient of this quantity to refine the mesh. The error indicator defined here takes the magnitude of the approximate gradient and scales it by $h_K^{1.5}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of each cell. This scaling ensures that the error indicators converge to zero as $h_K\rightarrow 0$ even if the energy density is discontinuous, since the gradient of a discontinuous function grows like $1/h_K$.

`topography': A class that implements a mesh refinement criterion, which always flags all cells in the uppermost layer for refinement. This is useful to provide high accuracy for processes at or close to the surface.

To use this refinement criterion, you may want to combine it with other refinement criteria, setting the 'Normalize individual refinement criteria' flag and using the 'max' setting for 'Refinement criteria merge operation'.

`velocity': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from the velocity field.

`viscosity': A mesh refinement criterion that computes refinement indicators from a field that describes the spatial variability of the logarithm of the viscosity, $\log\eta$. (We choose the logarithm of the viscosity because it can vary by orders of magnitude.)Because this quantity may not be a continuous function ($\eta$ may be a discontinuous function along discontinuities in the medium, for example due to phase changes), we approximate the gradient of this quantity to refine the mesh. The error indicator defined here takes the magnitude of the approximate gradient and scales it by $h_K^{1+d/2}$ where $h_K$ is the diameter of each cell and $d$ is the dimension. This scaling ensures that the error indicators converge to zero as $h_K\rightarrow 0$ even if the energy density is discontinuous, since the gradient of a discontinuous function grows like $1/h_K$.

However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression.

{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A comma separated list denoting those boundaries on which a traction force is prescribed, i.e., where known external forces act, resulting in an unknown velocity. This is often used to model ``open'' boundaries where we only know the pressure. This pressure then produces a force that is normal to the boundary and proportional to the pressure.

The format of valid entries for this parameter is that of a map given as ``key1 [selector]: value1, key2 [selector]: value2, key3: value3, ...'' where each key must be a valid boundary indicator (which is either an integer or the symbolic name the geometry model in use may have provided for this part of the boundary) and each value must be one of the currently implemented boundary traction models. ``selector'' is an optional string given as a subset of the letters 'xyz' that allows you to apply the boundary conditions only to the components listed. As an example, '1 y: function' applies the type 'function' to the y component on boundary 1. Without a selector it will affect all components of the traction.

{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A comma separated list denoting those boundaries on which the velocity is prescribed, i.e., where unknown external forces act to prescribe a particular velocity. This is often used to prescribe a velocity that equals that of overlying plates.

The format of valid entries for this parameter is that of a map given as ``key1 [selector]: value1, key2 [selector]: value2, key3: value3, ...'' where each key must be a valid boundary indicator (which is either an integer or the symbolic name the geometry model in use may have provided for this part of the boundary) and each value must be one of the currently implemented boundary velocity models. ``selector'' is an optional string given as a subset of the letters 'xyz' that allows you to apply the boundary conditions only to the components listed. As an example, '1 y: function' applies the type 'function' to the y component on boundary 1. Without a selector it will affect all components of the velocity.

Note that the no-slip boundary condition is a special case of the current one where the prescribed velocity happens to be zero. It can thus be implemented by indicating that a particular boundary is part of the ones selected using the current parameter and using ``zero velocity'' as the boundary values. Alternatively, you can simply list the part of the boundary on which the velocity is to be zero with the parameter ``Zero velocity boundary indicator'' in the current parameter section.

Note that when ``Use years in output instead of seconds'' is set to true, velocity should be given in m/yr.

\begin{itemize} \item net rotation \item angular momentum \item net translation \item linear momentum \item net x translation \item net y translation \item net z translation \item linear x momentum \item linear y momentum \item linear z momentum \end{itemize}

These are a selection of operations to remove certain parts of the nullspace from the velocity after solving. For some geometries and certain boundary conditions the velocity field is not uniquely determined but contains free translations and/or rotations. Depending on what you specify here, these non-determined modes will be removed from the velocity field at the end of the Stokes solve step.


The ``angular momentum'' option removes a rotation such that the net angular momentum is zero. The ``linear * momentum'' options remove translations such that the net momentum in the relevant direction is zero.  The ``net rotation'' option removes the net rotation of the domain, and the ``net * translation'' options remove the net translations in the relevant directions.  For most problems there should not be a significant difference between the momentum and rotation/translation versions of nullspace removal, although the momentum versions are more physically motivated. They are equivalent for constant density simulations, and approximately equivalent when the density variations are small.

Note that while more than one operation can be selected it only makes sense to pick one rotational and one translational operation.

\subsection{Parameters in section \tt Postprocess}
\label{parameters:Postprocess}

\item {\it Parameter name:} {\tt List of postprocessors}
\phantomsection\label{parameters:Postprocess/List of postprocessors}


\index[prmindex]{List of postprocessors}
\index[prmindexfull]{Postprocess!List of postprocessors}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A comma separated list of postprocessor objects that should be run at the end of each time step. Some of these postprocessors will declare their own parameters which may, for example, include that they will actually do something only every so many time steps or years. Alternatively, the text 'all' indicates that all available postprocessors should be run after each time step.

The following postprocessors are available:

`Stokes residual': A postprocessor that outputs the Stokes residuals during the iterative solver algorithm into a file stokes\_residuals.txt in the output directory.

`basic statistics': A postprocessor that computes some simplified statistics like the Rayleigh number and other quantities that only make sense in certain model setups.

`boundary densities': A postprocessor that computes the laterally averaged density at the top and bottom of the domain.

`boundary pressures': A postprocessor that computes the laterally averaged pressure at the top and bottom of the domain.

`composition statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the compositional fields, if present in this simulation. In particular, it computes maximal and minimal values of each field, as well as the total mass contained in this field as defined by the integral $m_i(t) = \int_\Omega c_i(\mathbf x,t) \; dx$.

`depth average': A postprocessor that computes depth averaged quantities and writes them into a file $<$depth\_average.ext$>$ in the output directory, where the extension of the file is determined by the output format you select. In addition to the output format, a number of other parameters also influence this postprocessor, and they can be set in the section \texttt{Postprocess/Depth average} in the input file.

In the output files, the $x$-value of each data point corresponds to the depth, whereas the $y$-value corresponds to the simulation time. The time is provided in seconds or, if the global ``Use years in output instead of seconds'' parameter is set, in years.

`dynamic topography': A postprocessor that computes a measure of dynamic topography based on the stress at the surface. The data is written into text files named 'dynamic\_topography.NNNNN' in the output directory, where NNNNN is the number of the time step.

The exact approach works as follows: At the centers of all cells that sit along the top surface, we evaluate the stress and evaluate the component of it in the direction in which gravity acts. In other words, we compute $\sigma_{rr}={\hat g}^T(2 \eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u)- \frac 13 (\textrm{div}\;\mathbf u)I)\hat g - p_d$ where $\hat g = \mathbf g/\|\mathbf g\|$ is the direction of the gravity vector $\mathbf g$ and $p_d=p-p_a$ is the dynamic pressure computed by subtracting the adiabatic pressure $p_a$ from the total pressure $p$ computed as part of the Stokes solve. From this, the dynamic topography is computed using the formula $h=\frac{\sigma_{rr}}{\|\mathbf g\| \rho}$ where $\rho$ is the density at the cell center.
The file format then consists of lines with Euclidiean coordinates followed by the corresponding topography value.

(As a side note, the postprocessor chooses the cell center instead of the center of the cell face at the surface, where we really are interested in the quantity, since this often gives better accuracy. The results should in essence be the same, though.)

`heat flux statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the (conductive) heat flux across boundaries. For each boundary indicator (see your geometry description for which boundary indicators are used), the heat flux is computed in outward direction, i.e., from the domain to the outside, using the formula $\int_{\Gamma_i} k \nabla T \cdot \mathbf n$ where $\Gamma_i$ is the part of the boundary with indicator $i$, $k$ is the thermal conductivity as reported by the material model, $T$ is the temperature, and $\mathbf n$ is the outward normal. Note that the quantity so computed does not include any energy transported across the boundary by material transport in cases where $\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf n \neq 0$.

As stated, this postprocessor computes the \textit{outbound} heat flux. If you are interested in the opposite direction, for example from the core into the mantle when the domain describes the mantle, then you need to multiply the result by -1.

`heating statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about heating, averaged by volume. 

`mass flux statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the mass flux across boundaries. For each boundary indicator (see your geometry description for which boundary indicators are used), the mass flux is computed in outward direction, i.e., from the domain to the outside, using the formula $\int_{\Gamma_i} \rho \mathbf v \cdot \mathbf n$ where $\Gamma_i$ is the part of the boundary with indicator $i$, $\rho$ is the density as reported by the material model, $\mathbf v$ is the velocity, and $\mathbf n$ is the outward normal. 

As stated, this postprocessor computes the \textit{outbound} mass flux. If you are interested in the opposite direction, for example from the core into the mantle when the domain describes the mantle, then you need to multiply the result by -1.

`pressure statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the pressure field.

`spherical velocity statistics': A postprocessor that computes radial, tangential and total RMS velocity.

`temperature statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the temperature field.

`topography': A postprocessor intended for use with a free surface.  After every step, it loops over all the vertices on the top surface and determines the maximum and minimum topography relative to a reference datum (initial box height for a box geometry model or initial radius for a sphere/spherical shell geometry model).  Outputs topography in meters

`tracers': A Postprocessor that creates tracer particles that follow the velocity field of the simulation. The particles can be generated and propagated in various ways and they can carry a number of constant or time-varying properties. The postprocessor can write output positions and properties of all tracers at chosen intervals, although this is not mandatory. It also allows other parts of the code to query the tracers for information.

`velocity boundary statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the velocity along the boundaries. For each boundary indicator (see your geometry description for which boundary indicators are used), the min and max velocity magnitude is computed.

`velocity statistics': A postprocessor that computes some statistics about the velocity field.

`viscous dissipation statistics': A postprocessor that computes the viscous dissipationfor the whole domain as: $\frac{1}{2} \int_{V} \sigma : \dot{\epsilon}dV$ = $\int_{V} (-p\nabla \cdot u+2\mu\dot{\epsilon}:\dot{\epsilon} - \frac{2\mu}{3}(\nabla\cdot u)^{2}) dV$.

The information produced by this postprocessor is a subset of what is generated by the 'heating statistics' postprocessor.

`visualization': A postprocessor that takes the solution and writes it into files that can be read by a graphical visualization program. Additional run time parameters are read from the parameter subsection 'Visualization'.

{\it Value:} 10


{\it Default:} 10


{\it Description:} The number of zones in depth direction within which we are to compute averages. By default, we subdivide the entire domain into 10 depth zones and compute temperature and other averages within each of these zones. However, if you have a very coarse mesh, it may not make much sense to subdivide the domain into so many zones and you may wish to choose less than this default. It may also make computations slightly faster. On the other hand, if you have an extremely highly resolved mesh, choosing more zones might also make sense.

{\it Description:} A comma separated list of tracer properties that should be tracked. By default none is selected, which means only position, velocity and id of the tracers are output. 

The following properties are available:

`function': Implementation of a model in which the tracer property is set by evaluating an explicit function at the initial position of each particle.

The file format is a simple text file, with as many columns as spatial dimensions and as many lines as tracers to be generated. Initial comment lines starting with `\#' will be discarded.All of the values that define this generator are read from a section ``Particle generator/Ascii file'' in the input file, see Section~\ref{parameters:Particle_20generator/Ascii_20file}.

`probability density function': Generate a random distribution of particles over the entire simulation domain. The probability density is prescribed in the form of a user-prescribed function. The format of this function follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}. The return value of the function is always checked to be a non-negative probability density but it can be zero inparts of the domain.

`random uniform': Generates a random uniform distribution of particles over the entire simulation domain.

`uniform box': Generate a uniform distribution of particles over a rectangular domain in 2D or 3D. Uniform here means the particles will be generated with an equal spacing in each spatial dimension. Note that in order to produce a regular distribution the number of generated tracers might not exactly match the one specified in the input file.

`uniform radial': Generate a uniform distribution of particlesover a spherical domain in 2D or 3D. Uniform here means the particles will be generated with an equal spacing in each spherical spatial dimension, i.e., the particles are created at positions that increase linearly with equal spacing in radius, colatitude and longitude around a certain center point. Note that in order to produce a regular distribution the number of generated tracers might not exactly match the one specified in the input file.

{\it Description:} Sometimes it is convenient to use symbolic constants in the expression that describes the function, rather than having to use its numeric value everywhere the constant appears. These values can be defined using this parameter, in the form `var1=value1, var2=value2, ...'.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both `pi' and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)

{\it Description:} The formula that denotes the function you want to evaluate for particular values of the independent variables. This expression may contain any of the usual operations such as addition or multiplication, as well as all of the common functions such as `sin' or `cos'. In addition, it may contain expressions like `if(x>0, 1, -1)' where the expression evaluates to the second argument if the first argument is true, and to the third argument otherwise.

You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

The path may also include the special text '\$ASPECT\_SOURCE\_DIR' which will be interpreted as the path in which the ASPECT source files were located when ASPECT was compiled.

{\it Description:} deal.II offers the possibility to linearly interpolate output fields of higher order elements to a finer resolution. This somewhat compensates the fact that most visualization software only offers linear interpolation between grid points and therefore the output file is a very coarse representation of the actual solution field. Activating this option increases the spatial resolution in each dimension by a factor equal to the polynomial degree used for the velocity finite element (usually 2). In other words, instead of showing one quadrilateral or hexahedron in the visualization per cell on which \aspect{} computes, it shows multiple (for quadratic elements, it will describe each cell of the mesh on which we compute as $2\times 2$ or $2\times 2\times 2$ cells in 2d and 3d, respectively; correspondingly more subdivisions are used if you use cubic, quartic, or even higher order elements for the velocity).

The effect of using this option can be seen in the following picture showing a variation of the output produced with the input files from Section~\ref{sec:shell-simple-2d}:

\begin{center}  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{viz/parameters/build-patches}\end{center}Here, the left picture shows one visualization cell per computational cell (i.e., the option is switch off, as is the default), and the right picture shows the same simulation with the option switched on. The images show the same data, demonstrating that interpolating the solution onto bilinear shape functions as is commonly done in visualizing data loses information.

Of course, activating this option also greatly increases the amount of data \aspect{} will write to disk: approximately by a factor of 4 in 2d, and a factor of 8 in 3d, when using quadratic elements for the velocity, and correspondingly more for even higher order elements.

\index[prmindex]{List of output variables}
\index[prmindexfull]{Postprocess!Visualization!List of output variables}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} A comma separated list of visualization objects that should be run whenever writing graphical output. By default, the graphical output files will always contain the primary variables velocity, pressure, and temperature. However, one frequently wants to also visualize derived quantities, such as the thermodynamic phase that corresponds to a given temperature-pressure value, or the corresponding seismic wave speeds. The visualization objects do exactly this: they compute such derived quantities and place them into the output file. The current parameter is the place where you decide which of these additional output variables you want to have in your output file.

The following postprocessors are available:

`Vp anomaly': A visualization output object that generates output showing the anomaly in the seismic compression wave speed $V_p$ as a spatially variable function with one value per cell. This anomaly is shown as a percentage change relative to the average value of $V_p$ at the depth of this cell.

`Vs anomaly': A visualization output object that generates output showing the anomaly in the seismic shear wave speed $V_s$ as a spatially variable function with one value per cell. This anomaly is shown as a percentage change relative to the average value of $V_s$ at the depth of this cell.

`artificial viscosity': A visualization output object that generates output showing the value of the artificial viscosity on each cell.

`boundary indicators': A visualization output object that generates output about the used boundary indicators. In a loop over the active cells, if a cell lies at a domain boundary, the boundary indicator of the face along the boundary is requested. In case the cell does not lie along any domain boundary, the cell is assigned the value of the largest used boundary indicator plus one. When a cell is situated in one of the corners of the domain, multiple faces will have a boundary indicator. This postprocessor returns the value of the first face along a boundary that is encountered in a loop over all the faces. 

`compositional vector': A visualization output object that outputs vectors whose components are derived from compositional fields. Input parameters for this postprocessor are defined in section Postprocess/Visualization/Compositional fields as vectors

`density': A visualization output object that generates output for the density.

`depth': A visualization output postprocessor that outputs the depth for all points inside the domain, as determined by the geometry model.

`dynamic topography': A visualization output object that generates output for the dynamic topography. The approach to determine the dynamic topography requires us to compute the stress tensor and evaluate the component of it in the direction in which gravity acts. In other words, we compute $\sigma_{rr}={\hat g}^T(2 \eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\frac 13 (\textrm{div}\;\mathbf u)I)\hat g - p_d$ where $\hat g = \mathbf g/\|\mathbf g\|$ is the direction of the gravity vector $\mathbf g$ and $p_d=p-p_a$ is the dynamic pressure computed by subtracting the adiabatic pressure $p_a$ from the total pressure $p$ computed as part of the Stokes solve. From this, the dynamic topography is computed using the formula $h=\frac{\sigma_{rr}}{\|\mathbf g\| \rho}$ where $\rho$ is the density at the cell center.

Strictly speaking, the dynamic topography is of course a quantity that is only of interest at the surface. However, we compute it everywhere to make things fit into the framework within which we produce data for visualization. You probably only want to visualize whatever data this postprocessor generates at the surface of your domain and simply ignore the rest of the data generated.

`error indicator': A visualization output object that generates output showing the estimated error or other mesh refinement indicator as a spatially variable function with one value per cell.

`friction heating': A visualization output object that generates output for the amount of friction heating often referred to as $\tau:\epsilon$. More concisely, in the incompressible case, the quantity that is output is defined as $\eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u):\varepsilon(\mathbf u)$ where $\eta$ is itself a function of temperature, pressure and strain rate. In the compressible case, the quantity that's computed is $\eta [\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]:[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]$.

`gravity': A visualization output object that outputs the gravity vector.

`heating': A visualization output object that generates output for all the heating terms used in the energy equation.

`material properties': A visualization output object that generates output for the material properties given by the material model.There are a number of other visualization postprocessors that offer to write individual material properties. However, they all individually have to evaluate the material model. This is inefficient if one wants to output more than just one or two of the fields provided by the material model. The current postprocessor allows to output a (potentially large) subset of all of the information provided by material models at once, with just a single material model evaluation per output point.

`melt fraction': A visualization output object that generates output for the melt fraction at the temperature and pressure of the current point (batch melting). Does not take into account latent heat. If there are no compositional fields, this postprocessor will visualize the melt fraction of peridotite (calculated using the anhydrous model of Katz, 2003). If there is at least one compositional field, the postprocessor assumes that the  first compositional field is the content of pyroxenite, and will visualize the melt fraction for a mixture of peridotite and pyroxenite (using the melting model of Sobolev, 2011 for pyroxenite). All the parameters that were used in these calculations can be changed in the input file, the most relevant maybe being the mass fraction of Cpx in peridotite in the Katz melting model (Mass fraction cpx), which right now has a default of 15\%. The corresponding p-T-diagrams can be generated by running the tests melt\_postprocessor\_peridotite and melt\_postprocessor\_pyroxenite.

`nonadiabatic pressure': A visualization output object that generates output for the non-adiabatic component of the pressure.

`nonadiabatic temperature': A visualization output object that generates output for the non-adiabatic component of the pressure.

`partition': A visualization output object that generates output for the parallel partition that every cell of the mesh is associated with.

`seismic vp': A visualization output object that generates output for the seismic P-wave speed.

`seismic vs': A visualization output object that generates output for the seismic S-wave speed.

`shear stress': A visualization output object that generates output for the 3 (in 2d) or 6 (in 3d) components of the shear stress tensor, i.e., for the components of the tensor $2\eta\varepsilon(\mathbf u)$ in the incompressible case and $2\eta\left[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I\right]$ in the compressible case. The shear stress differs from the full stress tensor by the absence of the pressure.

`specific heat': A visualization output object that generates output for the specific heat $C_p$.

`strain rate': A visualization output object that generates output for the norm of the strain rate, i.e., for the quantity $\sqrt{\varepsilon(\mathbf u):\varepsilon(\mathbf u)}$ in the incompressible case and $\sqrt{[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]:[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I]}$ in the compressible case.

`stress': A visualization output object that generates output for the 3 (in 2d) or 6 (in 3d) components of the stress tensor, i.e., for the components of the tensor $2\eta\varepsilon(\mathbf u)+pI$ in the incompressible case and $2\eta\left[\varepsilon(\mathbf u)-\tfrac 13(\textrm{tr}\;\varepsilon(\mathbf u))\mathbf I\right]+pI$ in the compressible case.

`thermal conductivity': A visualization output object that generates output for the thermal conductivity $k$.

`thermal diffusivity': A visualization output object that generates output for the thermal diffusivity $\kappa$=$\frac{k}{\rho c_p}$, with $k$ the thermal conductivity.

`thermal expansivity': A visualization output object that generates output for the thermal expansivity.

`thermodynamic phase': A visualization output object that generates output for the integer number of the phase that is thermodynamically stable at the temperature and pressure of the current point.

`vertical heat flux': A visualization output object that generates output for the heat flux in the vertical direction, which is the sum of the advective and the conductive heat flux, with the sign convention of positive flux upwards.

`viscosity': A visualization output object that generates output for the viscosity.

`viscosity ratio': A visualization output object that generates output for the ratio between dislocation viscosity and diffusion viscosity.

{\it Description:} Select one of the following models:

`ascii data': Implementation of a model in which the velocityis derived from files containing data in ascii format. Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of commentsif they begin with '\#', but one of these lines needs tocontain the number of grid points in each dimension asfor example '\# POINTS: 3 3'.The order of the data columns has to be 'x', 'y', 'v$_x$' , 'v$_y$' in a 2d model and  'x', 'y', 'z', 'v$_x$' , 'v$_y$' , 'v$_z$' in a 3d model.Note that the data in the input files need to be sorted in a specific order: the first coordinate needs to ascend first, followed by the second and the third at last in order to assign the correct data to the prescribed coordinates.If you use a spherical model, then the data will still be handled as cartesian,however the assumed grid changes. 'x' will be replaced by the radial distance of the point to the bottom of the model, 'y' by the azimuth angle and 'z' by the polar angle measured positive from the north pole. The grid will be assumed to be a latitude-longitude grid. Note that the order of spherical coordinates is 'r', 'phi', 'theta' and not 'r', 'theta', 'phi', since this allows for dimension independent expressions. 

`circle': This value describes a vector field that rotates around the z-axis with constant angular velocity (i.e., with a velocity that increases with distance from the axis). The pressure is set to zero.

`function': This plugin allows to prescribe the Stokes solution for the velocity and pressure field in terms of an explicit formula. The format of these functions follows the syntax understood by the muparser library, see Section~\ref{sec:muparser-format}.

{\it Description:} The file name of the material data. Provide file in format: (Velocity file name).\%s\%d where \%s is a string specifying the boundary of the model according to the names of the boundary indicators (of a box or a spherical shell).\%d is any sprintf integer qualifier, specifying the format of the current file number.

{\it Value:} 1


{\it Default:} 1


{\it Description:} Scalar factor, which is applied to the boundary velocity. You might want to use this to scale the velocities to a reference model (e.g. with free-slip boundary) or another plate reconstruction. Another way to use this factor is to convert units of the input files. The unit is assumed to bem/s or m/yr depending on the 'Use years in output instead of seconds' flag. If you provide velocities in cm/yr set this factor to 0.01.

\index[prmindex]{Function constants}
\index[prmindexfull]{Prescribed Stokes solution!Pressure function!Function constants}
{\it Value:} 


{\it Default:} 


{\it Description:} Sometimes it is convenient to use symbolic constants in the expression that describes the function, rather than having to use its numeric value everywhere the constant appears. These values can be defined using this parameter, in the form `var1=value1, var2=value2, ...'.

A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both `pi' and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)

\index[prmindex]{Function expression}
\index[prmindexfull]{Prescribed Stokes solution!Pressure function!Function expression}
{\it Value:} 0


{\it Default:} 0


{\it Description:} The formula that denotes the function you want to evaluate for particular values of the independent variables. This expression may contain any of the usual operations such as addition or multiplication, as well as all of the common functions such as `sin' or `cos'. In addition, it may contain expressions like `if(x>0, 1, -1)' where the expression evaluates to the second argument if the first argument is true, and to the third argument otherwise. For a full overview of possible expressions accepted see the documentation of the muparser library at http://muparser.beltoforion.de/.

If the function you are describing represents a vector-valued function with multiple components, then separate the expressions for individual components by a semicolon.

{\it Value:} x,y,t


{\it Default:} x,y,t


{\it Description:} The name of the variables as they will be used in the function, separated by commas. By default, the names of variables at which the function will be evaluated is `x' (in 1d), `x,y' (in 2d) or `x,y,z' (in 3d) for spatial coordinates and `t' for time. You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to `r,phi,theta,t' and then use these variable names in your function expression.

{\it Value:} end time


{\it Default:} end time


{\it Description:} A comma separated list of termination criteria that will determine when the simulation should end. Whether explicitly stated or not, the ``end time'' termination criterion will always be used.The following termination criteria are available:

`end step': Terminate the simulation once the specified timestep has been reached. 

`end time': Terminate the simulation once the end time specified in the input file has been reached. Unlike all other termination criteria, this criterion is \textit{always} active, whether it has been explicitly selected or not in the input file (this is done to preserve historical behavior of \aspect{}, but it also likely does not inconvenience anyone since it is what would be selected in most cases anyway).

`steady state velocity': A criterion that terminates the simulation when the RMS of the velocity field stays within a certain range for a specified period of time.

`user request': Terminate the simulation gracefully when a file with a specified name appears in the output directory. This allows the user to gracefully exit the simulation at any time by simply creating such a file using, for example, \texttt{touch output/terminate}. The file's location is chosen to be in the output directory, rather than in a generic location such as the Aspect directory, so that one can run multiple simulations at the same time (which presumably write to different output directories) and can selectively terminate a particular one.
