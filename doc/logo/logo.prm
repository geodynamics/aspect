# A simple setup for convection in a 2d shell.
# This model was used to generate ASPECT's logo, which can be recreated using
# the ASPECT version and dependencies specified below, and using the paraview
# state file and the output file in output/ and ParaView version 5.8.1.
# Alternatively the docker image gassmoeller/aspect-logo contains this version
# of ASPECT as a precompiled binary.  The docker image can be rebuild from the
# Dockerfile in this path.
#
# To recreate the output in paraview, load the state, adjust the file paths,
# and create a screenshot without the mesh with 4x the suggested resolution on
# a 1080p screen (6160 x 3176 px) and with a transparent background.
# For the mesh output disable the background, enable the mesh, and create a
# screenshot with 2x the suggested resolution on a 1080p screen (3080 x 1588
# px). Then crop the resulting figures to content and use in the .svg.
