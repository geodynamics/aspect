 * <li> Changed: To unify spelling, the environment variable that indicates
 * the directory in which deal.II is located is now called
 * <code>DEAL_II_DIR</code> instead of the old <code>DEAL_DIR</code>. The old
 * spelling is still accepted, however.

 * (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/05/31)
 *
 * <li> Fixed: Fix a bug in adiabatic initial conditions introduced in r1599.
 * <br>
 * (Juliane Dannberg, 2013/05/08)
