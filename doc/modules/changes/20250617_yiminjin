Changed: The deviator and second invariant of symmetric tensors are modified to
be consistent with the plane strain assumption in 2D. This fixes the
inconsistency between some material models and the Stokes assemblers when
computing the deviatoric strain rate. It also results in better nonlinear solver
convergence due to some fixes to the Newton solver.
