New: A new material model 'damage rheology' is added.
This model uses a compositional field to store and evolve a
quantity that represents the grain size, which influences
the viscosity. All other material properties can be read from 
data tables generated by Perplex or Hefesto, or set in similar
way to the 'simple' material model. Details about the model
are available in Dannberg et al., 2017 in G-Cubed.
