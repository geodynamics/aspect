Changed: The postprocessor 'heat flux map' now outputs the heat flux values in
the same format as the 'dynamic topography' postprocessor does for dynamic
topography. This in particular means instead of writing all values into a
single file 'heat flux map' now writes one file per boundary. Both
postprocessors now take care to not include spaces in the data file
headers so that separating the header columns by spaces works correctly.
