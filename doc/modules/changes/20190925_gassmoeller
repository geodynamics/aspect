New: Added a new parameter 'Temperature method' that controls how the
temperature equation is solved. The parameter works analogous to the
'Compositional field method' parameter, and the current options are 'field'
(the default temperature equation), and 'prescribed field', which allows the
material model to fill a PrescribedOutputs object that will set the temperature
field to defined values. This parameter is mostly useful if you have other ways
to determine temperature than by solving the temperature equation (e.g.
deriving from a compositional field, or from particles).
