New: There is a new initial temperature plug-in that determines 
initial temperature from a shear wave velocity (Vs) model (in km s$^-1$),
using the anelasticity parameterisation of Yamauchi & Takei 2016. 
The input shear wave velocities are read in from an ascii file located 
in the "data/initial_temperature/ascii-data/test" directory.
This plug-in is essentially the same as that used in the
"benchmarks/yamauchi_takei_2016_anelasticity" folder.
