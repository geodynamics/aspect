Changed: The particle interpolator 'bilinear least squares'
was renamed to 'linear least squares' and all references in the
repository have been renamed as well. This is to indicate that
while the interpolator was implemented as a bi/trilinear function
in the past, it had been changed since ASPECT 2.4.0.
