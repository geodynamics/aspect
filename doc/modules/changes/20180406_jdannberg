Overhaul of the melt solver. 
Changed: Models with melt transport now have a new preconditioner, 
and the linear system is solved in a different way: Based on the 
Darcy coefficient, each cell is classified as a melt cell 
(where the melt transport equations are solved) or not a melt 
cell (in this case, the compaction pressure dofs are constrained
to zero, and the equations that are solved are the Stokes system
without any melt-related terms). To achieve better convergence 
for low melt fractions, the compaction pressure p_c is replaced
by a scaled compaction pressure p_c_bar, so that the linear 
system we are solving is different than before, and the solution 
vector now contains p_c_bar instead of p_c. 
The advantages of these changes are much lower iteration counts in 
models with low or zero porosity, and that we are now solving 
the Stokes system if no melt is present.
