Fixed: The 'surface stress' postprocessor used the wrong sign for stresses,  
leading to incorrect stress directions in models with elastic deformation.  
Additionally, the 'stress second invariant' postprocessor had incorrect  
magnitude values due to a sign convention issue. These issues are now fixed.  

Fix applied in `surface_stress.cc` and `stress_second_invariant.cc`.
