Changed: The reference viscosity function is no longer part
of the material model interface (because we do not require 
it anymore for the pressure scaling or anywhere else). The
One material model affected by this is the depth-dependent
model, which now has its own reference viscosity parameter
rather than use the reference viscosity of the base model.
