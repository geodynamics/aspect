New: There is a new initial temperature plug-in that sets a specified 
lithosphere temperature above the lithsphere-asthenosphere boundary,
which is specified by an ascii file or a maximum lithopshere depth 
value. Below this the initial temperature is set as NaN. This 
plug-in can be combined with another using the 'replace if valid' 
operator.
