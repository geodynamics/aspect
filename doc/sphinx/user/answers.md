# Finding answers to questions

If you have questions that go beyond this manual, there are a number of
resources:

-   For questions on the source code of ASPECT,
    portability, installation, new or existing features, etc., use the
    ASPECT forum at
    <https://community.geodynamics.org/c/aspect>. This forum is where the
    ASPECT developers all hang out. Archived
    discussions from the archived aspect-devel mailing list can be downloaded
    at <https://geodynamics.org/pipermail/aspect-devel/>.

-   ASPECT is primarily based on the deal.II
    library (the dependency on Trilinos and p4est is primarily through
    deal.II, and not directly visible in the
    ASPECT source code). If you have particular
    questions about deal.II, use the official mailing list
    linked at <https://dealii.org/getting_help/contact/>.

-   In case of more general questions about mantle convection, you can ask on
    the CIG mantle convection forum at
    <https://community.geodynamics.org/c/mantle-convection/12>.

-   If you have specific questions about ASPECT
    that are not suitable for public and archived forums, you can contact the
    primary developers:
