The process of averaging, and where it may be used, is discussed in more detail in {ref}`sec:cookbooks:sinker-with-averaging`.

More averaging schemes are available in the averaging material model. This material model is a &ldquo;compositing material model&rdquo; which can be used in combination with other material models.

**Documentation:** The name of the material model to be used in this simulation. There are many material models you can choose from, as listed below. They generally fall into two category: (i) models that implement a particular case of material behavior, (ii) models that modify other models in some way. We sometimes call the latter &ldquo;compositing models&rdquo;. An example of a compositing model is the &ldquo;depth dependent&rdquo; model below in that it takes another, freely choosable model as its base and then modifies that model&rsquo;s output in some way.

You can select one of the following models:

&lsquo;Steinberger&rsquo;: This material model looks up the viscosity from the tables that correspond to the paper of Steinberger and Calderwood 2006 (&ldquo;Models of large-scale viscous flow in the Earth&rsquo;s mantle with constraints from mineral physics and surface observations&rdquo;, Geophys. J. Int., 167, 1461-1481, <http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03131.x>) and material data from a database generated by the thermodynamics code `Perplex`, see <http://www.perplex.ethz.ch/>. The default example data builds upon the thermodynamic database by Stixrude 2011 and assumes a pyrolitic composition by Ringwood 1988 but is easily replaceable by other data files.

&lsquo;ascii reference profile&rsquo;: A material model that reads in a reference state for density, thermal expansivity, compressibility and specific heat from a text file.
Note the required format of the input data: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with &lsquo;#&rsquo;, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of points in the reference state as for example &lsquo;# POINTS: 3&rsquo;. Following the comment lines there has to be a single line containing the names of all data columns, separated by arbitrarily many spaces. Column names are not allowed to contain spaces. The file can contain unnecessary columns, but for this plugin it needs to at least provide the columns named &lsquo;density&rsquo;, &lsquo;thermal\_expansivity&rsquo;, &lsquo;specific\_heat&rsquo;, and &lsquo;compressibility&rsquo;. Note that the data lines in the file need to be sorted in order of increasing depth from 0 to the maximal depth in the model domain. Points in the model that are outside of the provided depth range will be assigned the maximum or minimum depth values, respectively. Points do not need to be equidistant, but the computation of properties is optimized in speed if they are.

The viscosity $\eta$ is computed as $\eta(z,T) = \eta_r(z) \eta_0 \exp\left(-A \frac{T - T_{\text{adi}}}{T_{\text{adi}}}\right)$, where $\eta_r(z)$ is the depth-dependence, which is a piecewise constant function computed according to the list of &ldquo;Viscosity prefactors&rdquo; and &ldquo;Transition depths&rdquo;, $\eta_0$ is the reference viscosity specified by the parameter &ldquo;Viscosity&rdquo; and $A$ describes the dependence on temperature and corresponds to the parameter &ldquo;Thermal viscosity exponent&rdquo;.

&lsquo;averaging&rsquo;: The &ldquo;averaging&rdquo; Material model applies an averaging of the quadrature points within a cell. The values to average are supplied by any of the other available material models. In other words, it is a &ldquo;compositing material model&rdquo;. Parameters related to the average model are read from a subsection &ldquo;Material model/Averaging&rdquo;.

The user must specify a &ldquo;Base model&rdquo; from which material properties are derived. Furthermore an averaging operation must be selected, where the Choice should be from the list none|arithmetic average|harmonic average|geometric average|pick largest|log average|NWD arithmetic average|NWD harmonic average|NWD geometric average.

NWD stands for Normalized Weighed Distance. The models with this in front of their name work with a weighed average, which means each quadrature point requires an individual weight. The weight is determined by the distance, where the exact relation is determined by a bell shaped curve. A bell shaped curve is a continuous function which is one at its maximum and exactly zero at and beyond its limit. This bell shaped curve is spanned around each quadrature point to determine the weighting map for each quadrature point. The used bell shape comes from Lucy (1977). The distance is normalized so the largest distance becomes one. This means that if variable &rdquo;Bell shape limit&rdquo; is exactly one, the farthest quadrature point is just on the limit and its weight will be exactly zero. In this plugin it is not implemented as larger and equal than the limit, but larger than, to ensure the quadrature point at distance zero is always included.

&lsquo;compositing&rsquo;: The &ldquo;compositing&rdquo; Material model selects material model properties from a given set of other material models, and is intended to make mixing different material models easier. This is useful, for example, when wanting to use the melting parameterization of the &ldquo;melt simple&rdquo; model (which has a relatively simple viscosity model that only allows for a temperature- but not strain rate-dependent viscosity) with a more realistic viscosity model such as that provided by the &ldquo;diffusion dislocation&rdquo; model.

Specifically, this material model works by allowing to specify the name of another material model for each coefficient that material models are asked for (such as the viscosity, density, etc.). Whenever the material model is asked for the values of coefficients, it then evaluates all of the &ldquo;base models&rdquo; that were listed for the various coefficients, and copies the values returned by these base models into the output structure.

The implementation of this material model is somewhat expensive because it has to evaluate all material coefficients of all underlying material models. Consequently, if performance of assembly and postprocessing is important, then implementing a separate material model is a better choice than using this material model.

&lsquo;composition reaction&rsquo;: A material model that behaves in the same way as the simple material model, but includes two compositional fields and a reaction between them. Above a depth given in the input file, the first fields gets converted to the second field.

&lsquo;depth dependent&rsquo;: The &ldquo;depth dependent&rdquo; Material model applies a depth-dependent scaling to the viscosity of any other available material models. In other words, it is a &ldquo;compositing material model&rdquo;.

Parameters related to the depth dependent model are read from a subsection &ldquo;Material model/Depth dependent model&rdquo;. The user must specify a &ldquo;Base model&rdquo; from which material properties are derived. Currently the depth dependent model only allows depth dependence of viscosity - other material properties are taken from the &ldquo;Base model&rdquo;. Viscosity $\eta$ at depth $z$ is calculated according to:$ \eta(z,p,T,X,...) = \eta(z) \eta_b(p,T,X,..)/\eta_{r}$ where $\eta(z)$ is the depth-dependence specified by the depth dependent model, $\eta_b(p,T,X,...)$ is the viscosity calculated from the base model, and $\eta_{r}$ is the reference viscosity. In addition to the specification of the &ldquo;Base model&rdquo;, the user must specify the method to be used to calculate the depth-dependent viscosity $\eta(z)$ as &ldquo;Material model/Depth dependent model/Depth dependence method&rdquo;, which can be chosen among &ldquo;None|Function|File|List&rdquo;. Each method and the associated parameters are as follows:

&ldquo;Function&rdquo;: read a user-specified parsed function from the input file in a subsection &ldquo;Material model/Depth dependent model/Viscosity depth function&rdquo;. By default, this function is uniformly equal to 1.0e21. Specifying a function that returns a value less than or equal to 0.0 anywhere in the model domain will produce an error.

&ldquo;File&rdquo;: read a user-specified file containing viscosity values at specified depths. The file containing depth-dependent viscosities is read from a directory specified by the user as &ldquo;Material model/Depth dependent model/Data directory&rdquo;, from a file with name specified as &ldquo;Material model/Depth dependent model/Viscosity depth file&rdquo;. The format of this file is ascii text and contains two columns with one header line:

example Viscosity depth file:\\Depth (m)    Viscosity (Pa-s)\\0.0000000e+00     1.0000000e+21\\6.7000000e+05     1.0000000e+22\\

Viscosity is interpolated from this file using linear interpolation. &ldquo;None&rdquo;: no depth-dependence. Viscosity is taken directly from &ldquo;Base model&rdquo;

&ldquo;List:&rdquo;: read a comma-separated list of depth values corresponding to the maximum depths of layers having constant depth-dependence $\eta(z)$. The layers must be specified in order of increasing depth, and the last layer in the list must have a depth greater than or equal to the maximal depth of the model. The list of layer depths is specified as &ldquo;Material model/Depth dependent model/Depth list&rdquo; and the corresponding list of layer viscosities is specified as &ldquo;Material model/Depth dependent model/Viscosity list&rdquo;

&lsquo;diffusion dislocation&rsquo;: An implementation of a viscous rheology including diffusion and dislocation creep. Compositional fields can each be assigned individual activation energies, reference densities, thermal expansivities, and stress exponents. The effective viscosity is defined as

$\eta_{\text{eff}} = \left(\frac{1}{\eta_{\text{eff}}^\text{diff}}+ \frac{1}{\eta_{\text{eff}}^\text{dis}}\right)^{-1}$ where $\eta_{\text{i}} = \frac{1}{2} A^{-\frac{1}{n_i}} d^\frac{m_i}{n_i} \dot{\varepsilon_i}^{\frac{1-n_i}{n_i}} \exp\left(\frac{E_i^\ast + PV_i^\ast}{n_iRT}\right)$

where $d$ is grain size, $i$ corresponds to diffusion or dislocation creep, $\dot{\varepsilon}$ is the square root of the second invariant of the strain rate tensor, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature, and $P$ is pressure. $A_i$ are prefactors, $n_i$ and $m_i$ are stress and grain size exponents $E_i$ are the activation energies and $V_i$ are the activation volumes.

This form of the viscosity equation is commonly used in geodynamic simulations See, for example, Billen and Hirth (2007), G3, 8, Q08012. Significantly, other studies may use slightly different forms of the viscosity equation leading to variations in how specific terms are defined or combined. For example, the grain size exponent should always be positive in the diffusion viscosity equation used here, while other studies place the grain size term in the denominator and invert the sign of the grain size exponent. When examining previous work, one should carefully check how the viscous prefactor and grain size terms are defined.

The ratio of diffusion to dislocation strain rate is found by Newton&rsquo;s method, iterating to find the stress which satisfies the above equations. The value for the components of this formula and additional parameters are read from the parameter file in subsection &rsquo;Material model/DiffusionDislocation&rsquo;.

&lsquo;drucker prager&rsquo;: A material model that has constant values for all coefficients but the density and viscosity. The defaults for all coefficients are chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct for Earth&rsquo;s mantle. All of the values that define this model are read from a section &ldquo;Material model/Drucker Prager&rdquo; in the input file, see {ref}`parameters:Material_20model/Drucker_20Prager`. Note that the model does not take into account any dependencies of material properties on compositional fields.

The viscosity is computed according to the Drucker Prager frictional plasticity criterion (non-associative) based on a user-defined internal friction angle $\phi$ and cohesion $C$. In 3d:  $\sigma_y = \frac{6 C \cos(\phi)}{\sqrt{3} (3+\sin(\phi))} + \frac{6 P \sin(\phi)}{\sqrt{3} (3+\sin(\phi))}$, where $P$ is the pressure. See for example Zienkiewicz, O. C., Humpheson, C. and Lewis, R. W. (1975), G\&rsquo;{e}otechnique 25, No. 4, 671-689. With this formulation we circumscribe instead of inscribe the Mohr Coulomb yield surface. In 2d the Drucker Prager yield surface is the same as the Mohr Coulomb surface:  $\sigma_y = P \sin(\phi) + C \cos(\phi)$. Note that in 2d for $\phi=0$, these criteria revert to the von Mises criterion (no pressure dependence). See for example {cite}`thieulot:2011`.

Note that we enforce the pressure to be positive to prevent negative yield strengths and viscosities.

We then use the computed yield strength to scale back the viscosity on to the yield surface using the Viscosity Rescaling Method described in Kachanov, L. M. (2004), Fundamentals of the Theory of Plasticity, Dover Publications, Inc. (Not Radial Return.)A similar implementation can be found in GALE (<https://geodynamics.org/resources/gale>).

To avoid numerically unfavourably large (or even negative) viscosity ranges, we cut off the viscosity with a user-defined minimum and maximum viscosity: $\eta_{eff} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\eta_{min} + \eta}+ \frac{1}{\eta_{max}}}$.

Note that this model uses the formulation that assumes an incompressible medium despite the fact that the density follows the law $\rho(T)=\rho_0(1-\beta(T-T_{\text{ref}}))$.

&lsquo;entropy model&rsquo;: A material model that is designed to use pressure and entropy (rather than pressure and temperature) as independent variables. It requires a thermodynamic data table that contains all relevant properties in a specific format as illustrated in the data/material-model/entropy-table/opxtable example folder. The material model requires the use of the projected density approximation for compressibility, and the existence of a compositional field called &rsquo;entropy&rsquo;.

&lsquo;grain size&rsquo;: A material model that relies on compositional fields that correspond to the average grain sizes of a mineral phase and source terms that determine the grain size evolution in terms of the strain rate, temperature, phase transitions, and the creep regime. This material model only works if a compositional field named &rsquo;grain_size&rsquo; is present. In the diffusion creep regime, the viscosity depends on this grain size field. We use the grain size evolution laws described in Behn et al., 2009. Implications of grain size evolution on the seismic structure of the oceanic upper mantle, Earth Planet. Sci. Letters, 282, 178–189. Other material parameters are either prescribed similar to the &rsquo;simple&rsquo; material model, or read from data files that were generated by the Perplex or Hefesto software. This material model is described in more detail in Dannberg, J., Z. Eilon, U. Faul, R. Gassmoeller, P. Moulik, and R. Myhill (2017), The importance of grain size to mantle dynamics and seismological observations, Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst., 18, 3034–3061, doi:10.1002/2017GC006944.

&lsquo;latent heat&rsquo;: A material model that includes phase transitions and the possibility that latent heat is released or absorbed when material crosses one of the phase transitions of up to two different materials (compositional fields). This model implements a standard approximation of the latent heat terms following Christensen \& Yuen, 1985 {cite}`christensen:yuen:1985`. The change of entropy is calculated as $\Delta S = \gamma \frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho^2}$ with the Clapeyron slope $\gamma$ and the density change $\Delta\rho$ of the phase transition being input parameters. The model employs an analytic phase function in the form $X=\frac{1}{2} \left( 1 + \tanh \left( \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta p_0} \right) \right)$ with $\Delta p = p - p_{\text{transition}} - \gamma \left( T - T_{\text{transition}} \right)$ and $\Delta p_0$ being the pressure difference over the width of the phase transition (specified as input parameter).

&lsquo;latent heat melt&rsquo;: A material model that includes the latent heat of melting for two materials: peridotite and pyroxenite. The melting model for peridotite is taken from Katz et al., 2003 (A new parameterization of hydrous mantle melting) and the one for pyroxenite from Sobolev et al., 2011 (Linking mantle plumes, large igneous provinces and environmental catastrophes). The model assumes a constant entropy change for melting 100\% of the material, which can be specified in the input file. The partial derivatives of entropy with respect to temperature and pressure required for calculating the latent heat consumption are then calculated as product of this constant entropy change, and the respective derivative of the function the describes the melt fraction. This is linearly averaged with respect to the fractions of the two materials present. If no compositional fields are specified in the input file, the model assumes that the material is peridotite. If compositional fields are specified, the model assumes that the first compositional field is the fraction of pyroxenite and the rest of the material is peridotite.

Otherwise, this material model has a temperature- and pressure-dependent density and viscosity and the density and thermal expansivity depend on the melt fraction present. It is possible to extent this model to include a melt fraction dependence of all the material parameters by calling the function melt_fraction in the calculation of the respective parameter. However, melt and solid move with the same velocity and melt extraction is not taken into account (batch melting).

&lsquo;melt boukare&rsquo;: A material model that implements a simplified version of the melting model of Boukare et al. (https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JB011929) for the lowermost mantle and uses it to compute the material parameters required for the modeling of melt transport, including melting and solidification and the corresponding changes in composition.The model parameterizes the composition (which includes the components MgO, FeO and SiO2) as a mixture between two endmembers (one iron-bearing and one magnesium-bearing). The equation of state considers three phases: bridgmanite, ferropericlase, and melt (each with their individual compositions). More details can be found in Dannberg, J., Myhill, R., Gassmöller, R., and Cottaar, S. (2021). The morphology, evolution and seismic visibility of partial melt at the core–mantle boundary: implications for ULVZs. Geophysical Journal International, 227(2), 1028-1059.

&lsquo;melt global&rsquo;: A material model that implements a simple formulation of the material parameters required for the modeling of melt transport, including a source term for the porosity according to a simplified linear melting model similar to {cite}`schmeling2006`:
$\phi_{\text{equilibrium}} = \frac{T-T_{\text{sol}}}{T_{\text{liq}}-T_{\text{sol}}}$
with $T_{\text{sol}} = T_{\text{sol,0}} + \Delta T_p \, p + \Delta T_c \, C$
$T_{\text{liq}} = T_{\text{sol}}  + \Delta T_{\text{sol-liq}}$.

&lsquo;melt simple&rsquo;: A material model that implements a simple formulation of the material parameters required for the modeling of melt transport, including a source term for the porosity according to the melting model for dry peridotite of {cite}`katz:etal:2003`. This also includes a computation of the latent heat of melting (if the &lsquo;latent heat&rsquo; heating model is active).

Most of the material properties are constant, except for the shear, viscosity $\eta$, the compaction viscosity $\xi$, and the permeability $k$, which depend on the porosity; and the solid and melt densities, which depend on temperature and pressure:
 $\eta(\phi,T) = \eta_0 e^{\alpha(\phi-\phi_0)} e^{-\beta(T-T_0)/T_0}$, $\xi(\phi,T) = \xi_0 \frac{\phi_0}{\phi} e^{-\beta(T-T_0)/T_0}$, $k=k_0 \phi^n (1-\phi)^m$, $\rho=\rho_0 (1 - \alpha (T - T_{\text{adi}})) e^{\kappa p}$.

The model is compressible only if this is specified in the input file, and contains compressibility for both solid and melt.

&lsquo;modified tait&rsquo;: A material model that implements the thermal modified Tait equation of state as written in {cite}`HP2011`. Constant values are used for the thermal conductivity and viscosity. The defaults for all coefficients are chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct for Earth&rsquo;s mantle. All of the values that define this model are read from a section &ldquo;Material model/Modified Tait model&rdquo; in the input file, see {ref}`parameters:Material_20model/Modified_20Tait_20model`.

&lsquo;multicomponent&rsquo;: This incompressible model is for use with an arbitrary number of compositional fields, where each field represents a rock type which can have completely different properties from the others. However, each rock type itself has constant material properties.  The value of the  compositional field is interpreted as a volume fraction. If the sum of the fields is greater than one, they are renormalized.  If it is less than one, material properties  for &ldquo;background mantle&rdquo; make up the rest. When more than one field is present, the material properties are averaged arithmetically.  An exception is the viscosity, where the averaging should make more of a difference.  For this, the user selects between arithmetic, harmonic, geometric, or maximum composition averaging.

&lsquo;multicomponent compressible&rsquo;: This model is for use with an arbitrary number of compositional fields, where each field represents a rock type which can have completely different properties from the others. Each rock type is described by a self-consistent equation of state.  The value of the  compositional field is interpreted as a mass fraction. If the sum of the fields is greater than one, they are renormalized.  If it is less than one, material properties  for &ldquo;background mantle&rdquo; make up the rest. When more than one field is present, the material properties are averaged arithmetically by mass fraction (for specific heat), or volume fraction (for density, thermal expansivity and compressibility). The thermal conductivity is also arithmetically averaged by volume fraction. Finally, the viscosity is averaged by volume fraction, but the user can choose between arithmetic, harmonic, geometric or maximum composition averaging.

&lsquo;nondimensional&rsquo;: A material model for nondimensionalized computations for compressible or incompressible computations defined through Rayleigh number   ext{Ra} and Dissipation number Di. This model is made to be used with the Boussinesq, ALA, or TALA formulation.

The viscosity is defined as $\eta = \text{Di} / \text{Ra} \cdot \exp(-b T^\prime + c z)$ where $T^\prime$ is the temperature variation from the adiabatic temperature, $z$ is the depth, $b$ is given by &ldquo;Viscosity temperature prefactor&rdquo;, and $c$ by &ldquo;Viscosity depth prefactor&rdquo;. If $\text{Di}$ is zero, it will be replaced by 1.0 in $\eta$.

The density is defined as $\rho = \exp(\text{Di}/\gamma \cdot z)  (1.0 - \alpha T^\prime + \text{Di} \gamma p^\prime),$ where $\alpha=\text{Di}$ is the thermal expansion coefficient, $\gamma$ is the Grueneisen parameter, and $p^\prime$ is the pressure variation from the adiabatic pressure. The pressure dependent term is not present if &ldquo;TALA&rdquo; is enabled.

&lsquo;perplex lookup&rsquo;: A material model that has constant values for viscosity and thermal conductivity, and calculates other properties on-the-fly using PerpleX meemum. Compositional fields correspond to the individual components in the order given in the PerpleX file.

&lsquo;prescribed viscosity&rsquo;: A material model that applies a viscosity to a &rdquo;base model&rdquo; chosen from any of the other available material models. This prescribed viscosity material model allows the user to specify a function which describes where the viscosity should be prescribed and a second function which describes the viscosity in that region. This material model requires a base model which prescribes the viscosity and the other material parameters in the rest of the model.

&lsquo;reactive fluid transport&rsquo;: Material model that is designed to advect fluids and compute fluid release and absorption based on different models for fluid-rock interaction. At present, models where no fluid-rock interactions occur or the solid has zero solubility are available. The properties of the solid can be taken from another material model that is used as a base model.

&lsquo;replace lithosphere viscosity&rsquo;: The &ldquo;replace lithosphere viscosity&rdquo; Material model sets viscosity to a prescribed constant above the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (specified by an ascii file or maximum lithosphere depth). Below the lithosphere-asthenosphereboundary the viscosity is taken from any of the other available material model. In other words, it is a &ldquo;compositing material model&rdquo;.
Parameters related to the replace lithosphere viscosity model are read from a subsection &ldquo;Material model/Replace lithosphere viscosity&rdquo;. The user must specify a &ldquo;Base model&rdquo; from which other material properties are derived.
Note the required format of the input data file: The first lines may contain any number of comments if they begin with ‘#’, but one of these lines needs to contain the number of grid points in each dimension as for example ‘# POINTS: 3 3’. For a spherical model, the order of the data columns has to be&rsquo;phi&rsquo;, &rsquo;theta&rsquo;,&rsquo;depth (m)&rsquo;, where phi is the  azimuth angle and theta is the polar angle measured positive from the north pole.

&lsquo;simple&rsquo;: A material model that has constant values for all coefficients but the density and viscosity. The defaults for all coefficients are chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct for Earth&rsquo;s mantle. All of the values that define this model are read from a section &ldquo;Material model/Simple model&rdquo; in the input file, see {ref}`parameters:Material_20model/Simple_20model`.

This model uses the following set of equations for the two coefficients that are non-constant: \begin{align}  \eta(p,T,\mathfrak c) &= \tau(T) \zeta(\mathfrak c) \eta_0, \\  \rho(p,T,\mathfrak c) &= \left(1-\alpha (T-T_0)\right)\rho_0 + \Delta\rho \; c_0,\end{align}where $c_0$ is the first component of the compositional vector $\mathfrak c$ if the model uses compositional fields, or zero otherwise.

The temperature pre-factor for the viscosity formula above is defined as \begin{align}  \tau(T) &= H\left(e^{-\beta (T-T_0)/T_0}\right),\intertext{with}   \qquad\qquad H(x) &= \begin{cases}                            \tau_{\text{min}} & \text{if}\; x<\tau_{\text{min}}, \\                            x & \text{if}\; 10^{-2}\le x \le 10^2, \\                            \tau_{\text{max}} & \text{if}\; x>\tau_{\text{max}}, \\                         \end{cases}\end{align} where $x=e^{-\beta (T-T_0)/T_0}$, $\beta$ corresponds to the input parameter &ldquo;Thermal viscosity exponent&rdquo;, and $T_0$ to the parameter &ldquo;Reference temperature&rdquo;. If you set $T_0=0$ in the input file, the thermal pre-factor $\tau(T)=1$. The parameters $\tau_{\text{min}}$ and $\tau_{\text{max}}$ set the minimum and maximum values of the temperature pre-factor and are set using &ldquo;Maximum thermal prefactor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Minimum thermal prefactor&rdquo;. Specifying a value of 0.0 for the minimum or maximum values will disable pre-factor limiting.

The compositional pre-factor for the viscosity is defined as $ \zeta(\mathfrak c) = \xi^{c_0}$ if the model has compositional fields and equals one otherwise. $\xi$ corresponds to the parameter &ldquo;Composition viscosity prefactor&rdquo; in the input file.

Finally, in the formula for the density, $\alpha$ corresponds to the &ldquo;Thermal expansion coefficient&rdquo; and $\Delta\rho$ corresponds to the parameter &ldquo;Density differential for compositional field 1&rdquo;.

Note that this model uses the formulation that assumes an incompressible medium despite the fact that the density follows the law $\rho(T)=\rho_0(1-\alpha(T-T_{\text{ref}}))$.

:::{note}
Despite its name, this material model is not exactly &ldquo;simple&rdquo;, as indicated by the formulas above. While it was originally intended to be simple, it has over time acquired all sorts of temperature and compositional dependencies that weren&rsquo;t initially intended. Consequently, there is now a &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; material model that now fills the role the current model was originally intended to fill.
:::

&lsquo;simple compressible&rsquo;: A material model that has constant values for all coefficients but the density. The defaults for all coefficients are chosen to be similar to what is believed to be correct for Earth&rsquo;s mantle. All of the values that define this model are read from a section &ldquo;Material model/Simple compressible model&rdquo; in the input file, see {ref}`parameters:Material_20model/Simple_20compressible_20model`.

This model uses the following equations for the density: $ \rho(p,T) = \rho_0 \left(1-\alpha (T-T_a)\right) \exp{\beta (P-P_0))}$ This formulation for the density assumes that the compressibility provided by the user is the adiabatic compressibility ($\beta_S$). The thermal expansivity and isentropic compressibility implied by the pressure and temperature dependence are equal to the user-defined constant values only along the reference isentrope, and there is also an implicit pressure dependence to the heat capacity $C_p$ via Maxwell&rsquo;s relations.

&lsquo;simpler&rsquo;: A material model that has constant values except for density, which depends linearly on temperature: $ \rho(p,T) = \left(1-\alpha (T-T_0)\right)\rho_0.$

Note that this material model fills the role the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; material model was originally intended to fill, before the latter acquired all sorts of complicated temperature and compositional dependencies.

&lsquo;visco plastic&rsquo;: An implementation of an incompressible visco(elastic)-plastic rheology with options for selecting dislocation creep, diffusion creep or composite viscous flow laws. Prior to yielding, one may select to modify the viscosity to account for viscoelastic effects by setting the parameter &rsquo;Enable elasticity&rsquo; in subsection Formulation to true. Plasticity limits viscous stresses through a Drucker Prager yield criterion. The implementation of this material model is based heavily on the &lsquo;DiffusionDislocation&rsquo; (Bob Myhill), &lsquo;DruckerPrager&rsquo; (Anne Glerum), and &lsquo;Viscoelastic&rsquo; (John Naliboff) material models.

 The viscosity for dislocation or diffusion creep is defined as $ \eta = \frac 12 A^{-\frac{1}{n}} d^{\frac{m}{n}} \dot{\varepsilon}_{ii}^{\frac{1-n}{n}} \exp\left(\frac{E + PV}{nRT}\right)$ where $A$ is the prefactor, $n$ is the stress exponent, $\dot{\varepsilon}_{ii}$ is the square root of the deviatoric strain rate tensor second invariant, $d$ is grain size, $m$ is the grain size exponent, $E$ is activation energy, $V$ is activation volume, $P$ is pressure, $R$ is the gas exponent and $T$ is temperature. This form of the viscosity equation is commonly used in geodynamic simulations. See, for example, Billen and Hirth (2007), G3, 8, Q08012. Significantly, other studies may use slightly different forms of the viscosity equation leading to variations in how specific terms are defined or combined. For example, the grain size exponent should always be positive in the diffusion viscosity equation used here, while other studies place the grain size term in the denominator and invert the sign of the grain size exponent. When examining previous work, one should carefully check how the viscous prefactor and grain size terms are defined.

 One may select to use the diffusion ($\eta_{\text{diff}}$; $n=1$, $m\neq 0$), dislocation ($\eta_{\text{disl}}$, $n>1$, $m=0$) or composite $\frac{\eta_{\text{diff}} \eta_{\text{disl}}}{\eta_{\text{diff}}+\eta_{\text{disl}}}$ equation form.

 The diffusion and dislocation prefactors can be weakened with a factor between 0 and 1 according to the total or the viscous strain only.

 Viscosity is limited through one of two different &lsquo;yielding&rsquo; mechanisms.

The first plasticity mechanism limits viscous stress through a Drucker Prager yield criterion, where the yield stress in 3d is  $\sigma_y = \frac{6C\cos(\phi) + 2P\sin(\phi)} {\sqrt{3}(3+\sin(\phi))}$ and $\sigma_y = C\cos(\phi) + P\sin(\phi)$ in 2d. Above, $C$ is cohesion and $\phi$  is the angle of internal friction.  Note that the 2d form is equivalent to the Mohr Coulomb yield surface.  If $\phi$ is 0, the yield stress is fixed and equal to the cohesion (Von Mises yield criterion). When the viscous stress ($2\eta {\varepsilon}_{ii}$) exceeds the yield stress, the viscosity is rescaled back to the yield surface: $\eta_{y}=\sigma_{y}/(2{\varepsilon}_{ii})$. This form of plasticity is commonly used in geodynamic models. See, for example, Thieulot, C. (2011), PEPI 188, pp. 47-68.

The user has the option to linearly reduce the cohesion and internal friction angle as a function of the finite strain magnitude. The finite strain invariant or full strain tensor is calculated through compositional fields within the material model. This implementation is identical to the compositional field finite strain plugin and cookbook described in the manual (author: Gassmoeller, Dannberg). If the user selects to track the finite strain invariant ($e_{ii}$), a single compositional field tracks the value derived from $e_{ii}^t = (e_{ii})^{(t-1)} + \dot{e}_{ii}\; dt$, where $t$ and $t-1$ are the current and prior time steps, $\dot{e}_{ii}$ is the second invariant of the strain rate tensor and $dt$ is the time step size. In the case of the full strain tensor $F$, the finite strain magnitude is derived from the second invariant of the symmetric stretching tensor $L$, where $L = F [F]^T$. The user must specify a single compositional field for the finite strain invariant or multiple fields (4 in 2d, 9 in 3d) for the finite strain tensor. These field(s) must be the first listed compositional fields in the parameter file. Note that one or more of the finite strain tensor components must be assigned a non-zero value initially. This value can be be quite small (e.g., 1.e-8), but still non-zero. While the option to track and use the full finite strain tensor exists, tracking the associated compositional fields is computationally expensive in 3d. Similarly, the finite strain magnitudes may in fact decrease if the orientation of the deformation field switches through time. Consequently, the ideal solution is track the finite strain invariant (single compositional) field within the material and track the full finite strain tensor through particles.When only the second invariant of the strain is tracked, one has the option to track the full strain or only the plastic strain. In the latter case, strain is only tracked in case the material is plastically yielding, i.e. the viscous stress > yield stress.

Viscous stress may also be limited by a non-linear stress limiter that has a form similar to the Peierls creep mechanism. This stress limiter assigns an effective viscosity $\sigma_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\tau_y}{2\varepsilon_y} {\frac{\varepsilon_{ii}}{\varepsilon_y}}^{\frac{1}{n_y}-1}$ Above $\tau_y$ is a yield stress, $\varepsilon_y$ is the reference strain rate, $\varepsilon_{ii}$ is the strain rate and $n_y$ is the stress limiter exponent.  The yield stress, $\tau_y$, is defined through the Drucker Prager yield criterion formulation. This method of limiting viscous stress has been used in various forms within the geodynamic literature {cite}`chri92,vavv02,cibi13,cibi15`.When $n_y$ is 1, it essentially becomes a linear viscosity model, and in the limit $n_y\rightarrow \infty$ it converges to the standard viscosity rescaling method (concretely, values $n_y>20$ are large enough).

 The visco-plastic rheology described above may also be modified to include viscoelastic deformation, thus producing a viscoelastic plastic constitutive relationship.

 The viscoelastic rheology behavior takes into account the elastic shear strength (e.g., shear modulus), while the tensile and volumetric strength (e.g., Young&rsquo;s and bulk modulus) are not considered. The model is incompressible and allows specifying an arbitrary number of compositional fields, where each field represents a different rock type or component of the viscoelastic stress tensor. The stress tensor in 2d and 3d, respectively, contains 3 or 6 components. The compositional fields representing these components must be named and listed in a very specific format, which is designed to minimize mislabeling stress tensor components as distinct &rsquo;compositional rock types&rsquo; (or vice versa). For 2d models, the first three compositional fields must be labeled &rsquo;stress\_xx&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_yy&rsquo; and &rsquo;stress\_xy&rsquo;. In 3d, the first six compositional fields must be labeled &rsquo;stress\_xx&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_yy&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_zz&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_xy&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_xz&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_yz&rsquo;.

 Combining this viscoelasticity implementation with non-linear viscous flow and plasticity produces a constitutive relationship commonly referred to as partial elastoviscoplastic (e.g., pEVP) in the geodynamics community. While extensively discussed and applied within the geodynamics literature, notable references include: Moresi et al. (2003), J. Comp. Phys., v. 184, p. 476-497. Gerya and Yuen (2007), Phys. Earth.

 The overview below directly follows Moresi et al. (2003) eqns. 23-38. However, an important distinction between this material model and the studies above is the use of compositional fields, rather than particles, to track individual components of the viscoelastic stress tensor. The material model will be updated when an option to track and calculate viscoelastic stresses with particles is implemented.

 Moresi et al. (2003) begins (eqn. 23) by writing the deviatoric rate of deformation ($\hat{D}$) as the sum of elastic ($\hat{D_{e}}$) and viscous ($\hat{D_{v}}$) components: $\hat{D} = \hat{D_{e}} + \hat{D_{v}}$.  These terms further decompose into $\hat{D_{v}} = \frac{\tau}{2\eta}$ and $\hat{D_{e}} = \frac{\overset{\nabla}{\tau}}{2\mu}$, where $\tau$ is the viscous deviatoric stress, $\eta$ is the shear viscosity, $\mu$ is the shear modulus and $\overset{\nabla}{\tau}$ is the Jaumann corotational stress rate. This later term (eqn. 24) contains the time derivative of the deviatoric stress ($\dot{\tau}$) and terms that account for material spin (e.g., rotation) due to advection: $\overset{\nabla}{\tau} = \dot{\tau} + {\tau}W -W\tau$. Above, $W$ is the material spin tensor (eqn. 25): $W_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left (\frac{\partial V_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} - \frac{\partial V_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} \right )$.

 If plasticity is included, the deviatoric rate of deformation may be written as: $\hat{D} = \hat{D_{e}} + \hat{D_{v}} + \hat{D_{p}}$, where $\hat{D_{p}}$ is the plastic component. $\hat{D_{p}}$ decomposes to $\frac{\tau_{y}}{2\eta_{y}}$, where $\tau_{y}$ is the yield stress and $\eta_{y}$ is the viscosity rescaled to the yield surface. The Jaumann stress-rate can also be approximated using terms from the previous time step ($t$) and current time step ($t + \Delta t^{e}$): $\smash[t]{\overset{\nabla}{\tau}}^{t + \Delta t^{e}} \approx \frac{\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e} - \tau^{t}}}{\Delta t^{e}} - W^{t}\tau^{t} + \tau^{t}W^{t}$. In this material model, the size of the time step above ($\Delta t^{e}$) can be specified as the numerical time step size or an independent fixed time step. If the latter case is selected, the user has an option to apply a stress averaging scheme to account for the differences between the numerical and fixed elastic time step (eqn. 32). If one selects to use a fixed elastic time step throughout the model run, this can still be achieved by using CFL and maximum time step values that restrict the numerical time step to a specific time.

 The formulation above allows rewriting the total rate of deformation (eqn. 29) as
 $\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e}} = \eta_{eff} \left ( 2\hat{D}^{t + \triangle t^{e}} + \frac{\tau^{t}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} + \frac{W^{t}\tau^{t} - \tau^{t}W^{t}}{\mu}  \right )$.

 The effective viscosity (eqn. 28) is a function of the viscosity ($\eta$), elastic time step size ($\Delta t^{e}$) and shear relaxation time ($ \alpha = \frac{\eta}{\mu} $): $\eta_{eff} = \eta \frac{\Delta t^{e}}{\Delta t^{e} + \alpha}$ The magnitude of the shear modulus thus controls how much the effective viscosity is reduced relative to the initial viscosity.

 Elastic effects are introduced into the governing Stokes equations through an elastic force term (eqn. 30) using stresses from the previous time step: $F^{e,t} = -\frac{\eta_{eff}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} \tau^{t}$. This force term is added onto the right-hand side force vector in the system of equations.

 When plastic yielding occurs, the effective viscosity in equation 29 and 30 is the plastic viscosity (equation 36). If the current stress is below the plastic yield stress, the effective viscosity is still as defined in equation 28. During non-linear iterations, we define the current stress prior to yielding (e.g., value compared to yield stress) as $\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e}} = \eta_{eff} \left ( 2\hat{D}^{t + \triangle t^{e}} + \frac{\tau^{t}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} \right ) $

 Compositional fields can each be assigned individual values of thermal diffusivity, heat capacity, density, thermal expansivity and rheological parameters.

 If more than one compositional field is present at a given point, viscosities are averaged with an arithmetic, geometric harmonic (default) or maximum composition scheme.

 The value for the components of this formula and additional parameters are read from the parameter file in subsection  &rsquo;Material model/Visco Plastic&rsquo;.

&lsquo;viscoelastic&rsquo;: An implementation of a simple linear viscoelastic rheology that only includes the deviatoric components of elasticity. Specifically, the viscoelastic rheology only takes into account the elastic shear strength (e.g., shear modulus), while the tensile and volumetric strength (e.g., Young&rsquo;s and bulk modulus) are not considered. The model is incompressible and allows specifying an arbitrary number of compositional fields, where each field represents a different rock type or component of the viscoelastic stress tensor. The stress tensor in 2d and 3d, respectively, contains 3 or 6 components. The compositional fields representing these components must be named and listed in a very specific format, which is designed to minimize mislabeling stress tensor components as distinct &rsquo;compositional rock types&rsquo; (or vice versa). For 2d models, the first three compositional fields must be labeled &rsquo;stress\_xx&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_yy&rsquo; and &rsquo;stress\_xy&rsquo;. In 3d, the first six compositional fields must be labeled &rsquo;stress\_xx&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_yy&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_zz&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_xy&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_xz&rsquo;, &rsquo;stress\_yz&rsquo;.

 Expanding the model to include non-linear viscous flow (e.g., diffusion/dislocation creep) and plasticity would produce a constitutive relationship commonly referred to as partial elastoviscoplastic (e.g., pEVP) in the geodynamics community. While extensively discussed and applied within the geodynamics literature, notable references include: Moresi et al. (2003), J. Comp. Phys., v. 184, p. 476-497. Gerya and Yuen (2007), Phys. Earth.

This later term (eqn. 24) contains the time derivative of the deviatoric stress ($\dot{\tau}$) and terms that account for material spin (e.g., rotation) due to advection: $\overset{\nabla}{\tau} = \dot{\tau} + {\tau}W -W\tau$. Above, $W$ is the material spin tensor (eqn. 25): $W_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left (\frac{\partial V_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} - \frac{\partial V_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} \right )$.

If one selects to use a fixed elastic time step throughout the model run, this can still be achieved by using CFL and maximum time step values that restrict the numerical time step to a specific time.

 The formulation above allows rewriting the total deviatoric stress (eqn. 29) as
 $\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e}} = \eta_\text{eff} \left ( 2\hat{D}^{t + \triangle t^{e}} + \frac{\tau^{t}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} + \frac{W^{t}\tau^{t} - \tau^{t}W^{t}}{\mu}  \right )$.

 The effective viscosity (eqn. 28) is a function of the viscosity ($\eta$), elastic time step size ($\Delta t^{e}$) and shear relaxation time ($ \alpha = \frac{\eta}{\mu} $): $\eta_\text{eff} = \eta \frac{\Delta t^{e}}{\Delta t^{e} + \alpha}$ The magnitude of the shear modulus thus controls how much the effective viscosity is reduced relative to the initial viscosity.

 Elastic effects are introduced into the governing Stokes equations through an elastic force term (eqn. 30) using stresses from the previous time step: $F^{e,t} = -\frac{\eta_\text{eff}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} \tau^{t}$. This force term is added onto the right-hand side force vector in the system of equations.

 The value of each compositional field representing distinct rock types at a point is interpreted to be a volume fraction of that rock type. If the sum of the compositional field volume fractions is less than one, then the remainder of the volume is assumed to be &rsquo;background material&rsquo;.

 Several model parameters (densities, elastic shear moduli, thermal expansivities, thermal conductivies, specific heats) can be defined per-compositional field. For each material parameter the user supplies a comma delimited list of length N+1, where N is the number of compositional fields. The additional field corresponds to the value for background material. They should be ordered &rdquo;background, composition1, composition2...&rdquo;. However, the first 3 (2d) or 6 (3d) composition fields correspond to components of the elastic stress tensor and their material values will not contribute to the volume fractions. If a single value is given, then all the compositional fields are given that value. Other lengths of lists are not allowed. For a given compositional field the material parameters are treated as constant, except density, which varies linearly with temperature according to the thermal expansivity.

 When more than one compositional field is present at a point, they are averaged arithmetically. An exception is viscosity, which may be averaged arithmetically, harmonically, geometrically, or by selecting the viscosity of the composition field with the greatest volume fraction.

(parameters:Material_20model/Melt_20simple/Freezing_20rate)=
### __Parameter name:__ Freezing rate
**Default value:** 0.0

**Pattern:** [Double 0...MAX_DOUBLE (inclusive)]

**Documentation:** Freezing rate of melt when in subsolidus regions. If this parameter is set to a number larger than 0.0, it specifies the fraction of melt that will freeze per year (or per second, depending on the &ldquo;Use years in output instead of seconds&rdquo; parameter), as soon as the porosity exceeds the equilibrium melt fraction, and the equilibrium melt fraction falls below the depletion. In this case, melt will freeze according to the given rate until one of those conditions is not fulfilled anymore. The reasoning behind this is that there should not be more melt present than the equilibrium melt fraction, as melt production decreases with increasing depletion, but the freezing process of melt also reduces the depletion by the same amount, and as soon as the depletion falls below the equilibrium melt fraction, we expect that material should melt again (no matter how much melt is present). This is quite a simplification and not a realistic freezing parameterization, but without tracking the melt composition, there is no way to compute freezing rates accurately. If this parameter is set to zero, no freezing will occur. Note that freezing can never be faster than determined by the &ldquo;Melting time scale for operator splitting&rdquo;. The product of the &ldquo;Freezing rate&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Melting time scale for operator splitting&rdquo; defines how fast freezing occurs with respect to melting (if the product is 0.5, melting will occur twice as fast as freezing). Units: 1/yr or 1/s, depending on the &ldquo;Use years in output instead of seconds&rdquo; parameter.

### __Parameter name:__ Melting time scale for operator splitting
**Default value:** 1e3

**Pattern:** [Double 0...MAX_DOUBLE (inclusive)]

**Documentation:** Because the operator splitting scheme is used, the porosity field can not be set to a new equilibrium melt fraction instantly, but the model has to provide a melting time scale instead. This time scale defines how fast melting happens, or more specifically, the parameter defines the time after which the deviation of the porosity from the equilibrium melt fraction will be reduced to a fraction of $1/e$. So if the melting time scale is small compared to the time step size, the reaction will be so fast that the porosity is very close to the equilibrium melt fraction after reactions are computed. Conversely, if the melting time scale is large compared to the time step size, almost no melting and freezing will occur.

Also note that the melting time scale has to be larger than or equal to the reaction time step used in the operator splitting scheme, otherwise reactions can not be computed. Units: yr or s, depending on the &ldquo;Use years in output instead of seconds&rdquo; parameter.

### __Parameter name:__ Fluid reaction time scale for operator splitting
**Default value:** 1e3

**Pattern:** [Double 0...MAX_DOUBLE (inclusive)]

**Documentation:** In case the operator splitting scheme is used, the porosity field can not be set to a new equilibrium fluid fraction instantly, but the model has to provide a reaction time scale instead. This time scale defines how fast fluid release and absorption happen, or more specifically, the parameter defines the time after which the deviation of the porosity from the free fluid fraction that would be in equilibrium with the solid will be reduced to a fraction of $1/e$. So if the fluid reaction time scale is small compared to the time step size, the reaction will be so fast that the porosity is very close to this equilibrium value after reactions are computed. Conversely, if the fluid reaction time scale is large compared to the time step size, almost no fluid release and absorption will occur.

Also note that the fluid reaction time scale has to be larger than or equal to the reaction time step used in the operator splitting scheme, otherwise reactions can not be computed. If the model does not use operator splitting, this parameter is not used. Units: yr or s, depending on the &ldquo;Use years in output instead of seconds&rdquo; parameter.

### __Parameter name:__ Freezing rate
**Default value:** 0.0

**Pattern:** [Double 0...MAX_DOUBLE (inclusive)]

**Documentation:** Freezing rate of melt when in subsolidus regions. If this parameter is set to a number larger than 0.0, it specifies the fraction of melt that will freeze per year (or per second, depending on the &ldquo;Use years in output instead of seconds&rdquo; parameter), as soon as the porosity exceeds the equilibrium melt fraction, and the equilibrium melt fraction falls below the depletion. In this case, melt will freeze according to the given rate until one of those conditions is not fulfilled anymore. The reasoning behind this is that there should not be more melt present than the equilibrium melt fraction, as melt production decreases with increasing depletion, but the freezing process of melt also reduces the depletion by the same amount, and as soon as the depletion falls below the equilibrium melt fraction, we expect that material should melt again (no matter how much melt is present). This is quite a simplification and not a realistic freezing parameterization, but without tracking the melt composition, there is no way to compute freezing rates accurately. If this parameter is set to zero, no freezing will occur. Note that freezing can never be faster than determined by the &ldquo;Melting time scale for operator splitting&rdquo;. The product of the &ldquo;Freezing rate&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Melting time scale for operator splitting&rdquo; defines how fast freezing occurs with respect to melting (if the product is 0.5, melting will occur twice as fast as freezing).

### __Parameter name:__ Melting time scale for operator splitting
**Default value:** 1e3

**Pattern:** [Double 0...MAX_DOUBLE (inclusive)]

**Documentation:** Because the operator splitting scheme is used, the porosity field can not be set to a new equilibrium melt fraction instantly, but the model has to provide a melting time scale instead. This time scale defines how fast melting happens, or more specifically, the parameter defines the time after which the deviation of the porosity from the equilibrium melt fraction will be reduced to a fraction of $1/e$. So if the melting time scale is small compared to the time step size, the reaction will be so fast that the porosity is very close to the equilibrium melt fraction after reactions are computed. Conversely, if the melting time scale is large compared to the time step size, almost no melting and freezing will occur.

Also note that the melting time scale has to be larger than or equal to the reaction time step used in the operator splitting scheme, otherwise reactions can not be computed. Units: yr or s, depending on the &ldquo;Use years in output instead of seconds&rdquo; parameter.

(2013): Mantle dynamics with pressure- and temperature-dependent thermal expansivity and conductivity (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2013.02.004) to compute the thermal conductivity in dependence of temperature and pressure. The thermal conductivity parameter sets can be chosen in such a way that either the Stackhouse or the Tosi relations are used. The conductivity description can consist of several layers with different sets of parameters. Note that the Stackhouse parametrization is only valid for the lower mantle (bridgmanite).

**Documentation:** Whether to apply strain weakening to viscosity, cohesion and internal angleof friction based on accumulated finite strain, and if yes, which method to use. The following methods are available:

\item &ldquo;none&rdquo;: No strain weakening is applied.

\item &ldquo;finite strain tensor&rdquo;: The full finite strain tensor is tracked, and its second invariant is used to weaken both the plastic yield stress (specifically, the cohesion and friction angle) and the pre-yield viscosity that arises from diffusion and/or dislocation creep.

\item &ldquo;total strain&rdquo;: The finite strain is approximated as the product of the second invariant of the strain rate in each time step and the time step size, and this quantity is integrated and tracked over time. It is used to weaken both the plastic yield stress (specifically, the cohesion and friction angle) and the pre-yield viscosity.

\item &ldquo;plastic weakening with plastic strain only&rdquo;: The finite strain is approximated as the product of the second invariant of the strain ratein each time step and the time step size in regions where material is plastically yielding. This quantity is integrated and tracked over time, and used to weaken the cohesion and friction angle. The pre-yield viscosity is not weakened.

\item &ldquo;plastic weakening with total strain only&rdquo;: The finite strain is approximated as the product of the second invariant of the strain rate in each time step and the time step size, and this quantity is integrated and tracked over time. It is used to weaken the plastic yield stress (specifically, the cohesion and internal friction angle). The pre-yield viscosity is not weakened.

\item &ldquo;plastic weakening with plastic strain and viscous weakening with viscous strain&rdquo;: Both the finite strain accumulated by plastic deformation and by viscous deformation are computed separately (each approximated as the product of the second invariant of the corresponding strain rate in each time step and the time step size). The plastic strain is used to weaken the plastic yield stress (specifically, the cohesion and yield angle), and the viscous strain is used to weaken the pre-yield viscosity.

\item &ldquo;viscous weakening with viscous strain only&rdquo;: The finite strain is approximated as the product of the second invariant of the strain rate in each time step and the time step size in regions where material is not plastically yielding. This quantity is integrated and tracked over time, and used to weaken the pre-yield viscosity. The cohesion and friction angle are not weakened.

\item &ldquo;default&rdquo;: The default option has the same behavior as &ldquo;none&rdquo;, but is there to make sure that the original parameters for specifying the strain weakening mechanism (&ldquo;Use plastic/viscous strain weakening&rdquo;) are still allowed, but to guarantee that one uses either the old parameter names or the new ones, never both.

If a compositional field named &rsquo;noninitial\_plastic\_strain&rsquo; is included in the parameter file, this field will automatically be excluded from from volume fraction calculation and track the cumulative plastic strain with the initial plastic strain values removed.

(parameters:Material_20model/Visco_20Plastic/Friction_20function/Variable_20names)=
### __Parameter name:__ Variable names
**Default value:** x,y,t

**Pattern:** [Anything]

**Documentation:** The names of the variables as they will be used in the function, separated by commas. By default, the names of variables at which the function will be evaluated are &lsquo;x&rsquo; (in 1d), &lsquo;x,y&rsquo; (in 2d) or &lsquo;x,y,z&rsquo; (in 3d) for spatial coordinates and &lsquo;t&rsquo; for time. You can then use these variable names in your function expression and they will be replaced by the values of these variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can also choose a different set of names for the independent variables at which to evaluate your function expression. For example, if you work in spherical coordinates, you may wish to set this input parameter to &lsquo;r,phi,theta,t&rsquo; and then use these variable names in your function expression.

### __Parameter name:__ Fixed elastic time step
**Default value:** 1.e3

**Pattern:** [Double 0...MAX_DOUBLE (inclusive)]

**Documentation:** The fixed elastic time step $dte$. Units: years if the &rsquo;Use years in output instead of seconds&rsquo; parameter is set; seconds otherwise.

(parameters:Material_20model/Viscoelastic/Heat_20capacities)=
### __Parameter name:__ Heat capacities

**Deprecation Status:** false

(parameters:Material_20model/Viscoelastic/Stabilization_20time_20scale_20factor)=
### __Parameter name:__ Stabilization time scale factor
**Default value:** 1.

**Pattern:** [Double 1...MAX_DOUBLE (inclusive)]

**Documentation:** A stabilization factor for the elastic stresses that influences how fast elastic stresses adjust to deformation. This value is equal to the elastic time step divided by the computational time step. The default value of 1.0 may lead to oscillatory motion. Increasing this factor to 2.0 can reduce oscillations while preserving an immediate elastic response. In complex models the factor can be increased further to improve convergence behaviour. As the stabilization factor increases, the effective viscosity gets smaller, and is balanced by an increasing body force term. For composite rheologies that use this formulation of elasticity, setting an infinite shear modulus only recovers the nonelastic part of the rheology if this stabilization factor is equal to 1.0.

(parameters:Material_20model/Viscoelastic/Thermal_20conductivities)=

**Pattern:** [Anything]

**Documentation:** List of thermal expansivities for background mantle and compositional fields,for a total of N+M+1 values, where N is the number of compositional fields and M is the number of phases. If only one value is given, then all use the same value. Units: \si{\per\kelvin}.

(parameters:Material_20model/Viscoelastic/Use_20fixed_20elastic_20time_20step)=
### __Parameter name:__ Use fixed elastic time step
**Default value:** unspecified

**Pattern:** [Selection true|false|unspecified ]

**Documentation:** Select whether the material time scale in the viscoelastic constitutive relationship uses the regular numerical time step or a separate fixed elastic time step throughout the model run. The fixed elastic time step is always used during the initial time step. If a fixed elastic time step is used throughout the model run, a stress averaging scheme is applied to account for differences with the numerical time step. An alternative approach is to limit the maximum time step size so that it is equal to the elastic time step. The default value of this parameter is &rsquo;unspecified&rsquo;, which throws an exception during runtime. In order for the model to run the user must select &rsquo;true&rsquo; or &rsquo;false&rsquo;.

**Pattern:** [Selection arithmetic|harmonic|geometric|maximum composition  ]

**Documentation:** When more than one compositional field is present at a point with different viscosities, we need to come up with an average viscosity at that point.  Select a weighted harmonic, arithmetic, geometric, or maximum composition.
