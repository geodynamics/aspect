viscosity = vis_lateral * vis_radial

vis_radial:
radial-visc.txt (lookup with depth)

vis_lateral:
temp-viscosity-prefactor.txt (with depth)
-> value / adiabatic_temperature * (adiabatic_temperature-temperature) / (temperature)

(steinberger/calderwood, modification of Formula (6), we replaced the average_temperature by the adiabatic temperature, since the consequence that the viscosity stays constant although the temperature and the lateral averaged temperature increase does not seem to be reasonable for our models) 

thermal_expansivity: lookup table
specific heat: lookup table
density: lookup table
thermal conductivity: constant

The provided lookup table was constructed with the software PERPLEX (Connolly, 2005) using the thermodynamic database by Stixrude (2011) and assuming a pyrolitic composition (Ringwood 1988).

For more explanation, see the cookbook on "Convection using a pressure--temperature look-up table and the rheology of Steinberger and Calderwood (2006)".
