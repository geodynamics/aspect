# This is a cookbook which aims to replicate the corner flow style subduction outlined
# in van Keken et al., 2008. In this cookbook, a slab with a thermal age of 50 Myr is
# subducted beneath a 50 km thick overriding plate at a constant dip of 45 degrees. The
# velocity is prescribed to be 5 cm/yr in the subducting plate, and 0 in the overriding
# plate. Due to these constraints, and the way that ASPECT usually generates a mesh,
# a custom mesh is used to prevent an ill-posed pressure solution at the triple point
# intersection between the mantle wedge, overriding plate, and down going plate.
