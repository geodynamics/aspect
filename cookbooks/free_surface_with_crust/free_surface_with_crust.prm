# This cookbook is an extension of the free_surface cookbook. Please see the
# other cookbook for details about the free surface. This cookbook illustrates
# how to use an external plugin to modify the material model, and what
# influence a viscous crust has on the magnitude of surface topography.

# This model loads an additional shared library, which provides another
# material model that is not part of the main ASPECT code, but instead
# lies in in a subdirectory of this cookbook folder.
