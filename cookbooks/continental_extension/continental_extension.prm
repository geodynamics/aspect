# Initial temperature field
# Typical continental geotherm based on equations 4-6 from:
#   D.S. Chapman (1986), "Thermal gradients in the continental crust",
#   Geological Society of London Special Publications, v.24, p.63-70.
# The initial constraints are:
#   Surface Temperature  - upper crust (ts1) = 273 K
#   Surface Heat Flow    - upper crust (qs1) = 0.055 W/m^2
#   Heat Production      - upper crust (A1)  = 1.00e-6 W/m^3;
#   Heat Production      - lower crust (A2)  = 0.25e-6 W/m^3;
#   Heat Production      - mantle (A3)       = 0.00e-6 W/m^3;
#   Thermal Conductivity - all layers        = 2.5 (W/(m K));
# To satisfy these constraints, the following values are required:
#   Surface Temperature  - lower crust (ts2) = 633 K
#                        - mantle (ts3)      = 893 K
#   Surface Heat Flow    - lower crust (qs2) = 0.035 W/m^2;
#                        - mantle      (qs3) = 0.030 W/m^2;
# Note: The continental geotherm initial temperature model
#       plugin can be used to compute an identical geotherm
#       for the lithosphere. An example of how to use this
#       plugin is illustrated in the test for this cookbook
#       (tests/continental_extension.prm).
