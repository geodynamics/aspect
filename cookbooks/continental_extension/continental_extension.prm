#   D.S. Chapman (1986), "Thermal gradients in the continental crust",
#   Geological Society of London Special Publications, v.24, p.63-70.
# The initial constraints are:
#   Surface Temperature  - upper crust (ts1) = 273 K
#   Surface Heat Flow    - upper crust (qs1) = 0.055 W/m^2
#   Heat Production      - upper crust (A1)  = 1.00e-6 W/m^3;

#   Thermal Conductivity - all layers        = 2.5 (W/(m K));
# To satisfy these constraints, the following values are required:
#   Surface Temperature  - lower crust (ts2) = 633 K
#                        - mantle (ts3)      = 893 K
