In the crustal deformation examples above, the viscosity depends solely on the
Drucker Prager yield criterion defined by the cohesion and internal friction
angle. While this approximation works reasonably well for the uppermost crust,
deeper portions of the lithosphere may undergo a combination of brittle, viscous,
or elastic deformation, which depend on a combination of composition,
temperature, pressure and strain-rate. In effect, a combination of the
Drucker-Prager, Diffusion dislocation, and Viscoelastic material models is required.
The visco-plastic material model is designed to take into account both brittle
(plastic), non-linear viscous flow, and viscoelastic deformation, thus providing
a template for modeling complex lithospheric processes. This material model can be
selected using the following set of input parameters:

This cookbook provides one such example where the continental lithosphere
undergoes extension. Notably, the model design follows that of numerous
previously published continental extension studies ({cite}`Hui11,Bru14,Nal15` and references therein)

## Continental Extension

The 2D Cartesian model spans 200 ($x$) by 100 ($y$) km and has a finite
element grid with 1.25 and 2.5 km grid spacing, respectively, above and below
50 km depth. This variation in grid spacing is achieved with a single initial
adaptive refinement step using the minimum refinement function strategy.
Unlike the crustal deformation cookbook (see {ref}`sec:cookbooks:crustal-deformation`),
the mesh is not refined with time.

Similar to the crustal deformation examples above, this model contains a free
surface. However, in this example the free surface is advected using the full
velocity (e.g., normal projection) rather than only the vertical component. As
this projection can lead to significant surface mesh deformation and associated
solver convergence issues, diffusion is applied to the free surface at each
time step. Deformation is driven by constant horizontal (x-component)
velocities (0.25 cm/yr) on the side boundaries (y-velocity component
unconstrained), while the bottom boundary has vertical inflow to balance the
lateral outflow. The top, and bottom boundaries have fixed temperatures, while
the sides are insulating. The bottom boundary is also assigned a fixed
composition, while the top and sides are unconstrained.

Sections of the lithosphere with distinct properties are represented by
compositional fields for the upper crust (20 km thick), lower crust (20 km
thick) and mantle lithosphere (60 km thick), which are tracked and advected
with particles. Material (viscous flow law parameters, cohesion, internal
friction angle) and thermodynamic properties for each compositional field
are based largely on previous numerical studies. Dislocation creep viscous
flow parameters are taken from published deformation experiments for wet
quartzite ({cite}`gleason:tullis:1995`), wet anorthite ({cite}`RGWD06`) and dry
olivine ({cite}`HK04`). Additional compositional fields are used to track plastic
strain and the non-initial plastic strain, with the latter value tracking
the same quantity as the plastic strain absent the initial plastic strain
values. As discussed further on, the plastic strain is used to soften
(e.g., reduce) the friction and cohesion through time based on user-specified
bounds and magnitudes. The initial randomized values of plastic strain in
the model center localize distributed deformation in this region.

The initial thermal structure, radiogenic heating model and associated thermal
properties are consistent with the prescribed thermal boundary conditions and
produce a geotherm characteristic of the continental lithosphere. The
equations defining the initial geotherm ({cite}`Cha86`) follow the form
```{math}
\begin{aligned}
  \label{eq:continental-geotherm-1}
  T(z) = T_T + \frac{q_T}{k}z - \frac{Az^2}{2k}
\end{aligned}
```
where $T$ is temperature, $z$ is depth, $T_T$ is the temperature at the layer surface
(top), $q_T$ is surface heat flux, $k$ is thermal conductivity, and $A$ is
radiogenic heat production.

For a layer thickness $\Delta z$, the basal temperature ($T_B$) and heat flux
($q_B$)
```{math}
 \begin{aligned}
   T_B = T_T + \frac{q_T}{k} \Delta z - \frac{A \Delta z^2}{2k}
   q_B = q_T - A \Delta z.
 \end{aligned}
```

In this example, specifying the top (273 $K$) temperature, surface heat
flow (55 $mW / m^2$), thermal conductivity, and radiogenic heat production
of each layer provides enough constraints to successively solve for the
temperature and heat flux at the top of the lower crust and mantle.

As noted above, the initial zone of randomized plastic strain within the model
center and strain softening of the friction and cohesion produces an initial
pattern of distributed and unlocalized deformation across the zone of initial
plastic strain ({numref}`fig:continental_extension_cookbook_0myr`).
After 5 million years of extension, distributed faulting is clearly evident
in both the active and finite deformation fields and surface topography over
an approximately 100 km wide region ({numref}`fig:continental_extension_cookbook_5myr`).
While deformation is distributed within this region, the fault system is clearly
asymmetric as the rate of deformation and accumulated brittle strain varies between faults.
Localization onto both rift-bounding and inter-rift faults is evident
from the active deformation field.

With further extension for millions of years, significant crustal thinning and
surface topography development should occur in response to displacement along
the rift-bounding faults. However, given that the model only extends to 100 km
depth, the simulation will not produce a realistic representation of
continental breakup due to the lack of an upwelling asthenosphere layer.
Indeed, numerical studies that examine continental breakup, rather than just
the initial stages of continental extension, include an asthenospheric layer
or modified basal boundary conditions (e.g. Winkler boundary condition in
{cite}`Bru14` for example) as temperature variations associated with
lithospheric thinning exert a first-order influence on the deformation
patterns. As noted below, numerous additional parameters may also affect the
temporal evolution of deformation patterns.
