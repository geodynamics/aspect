# At the top, we define the number of space dimensions we would like to

set Dimension                              = 2

# There are several global variables that have to do with what
# time system we want to work in and what the end time is. We
# also designate an output directory.

# Then there are variables that describe how the pressure should
# be normalized. Here, we choose a zero average pressure
# at the surface of the domain (for the current geometry, the
# surface is defined as the top boundary).

# Then come a number of sections that deal with the setup
# of the problem to solve. The first one deals with the
# geometry of the domain within which we want to solve.
# The sections that follow all have the same basic setup
# where we select the name of a particular model (here,
# the box geometry) and then, in a further subsection,
# set the parameters that are specific to this particular
# model.

# The next section deals with the initial conditions for the
# temperature. Note that there are no initial conditions for the
# velocity variable since the velocity is assumed to always
# be in a static equilibrium with the temperature field.
# There are a number of models with the 'function' model
# a generic one that allows us to enter the actual initial
# conditions in the form of a formula that can contain
# constants. We choose a linear temperature profile that
# matches the boundary conditions defined below plus
# a small perturbation. The variables in this equation are
# described below, and it is important to note that in many
# cases the values correspond to other model parameters
# defined elsewhere. As such, if these model parameters are
# changed, the values below will also need to be adjusted.
#   L - Model length/width
#   D - Model depth/height
#   T_top - Temperature at the top boundary
#   T_bottom - Temperature at the bottom boundary
#   p, k - values related to the small temperature perturbation

end

# Then follows a section that describes the boundary conditions
# for the temperature. The model we choose is called 'box' and
# allows to set a constant temperature on each of the four sides
# of the box geometry. In our case, we choose something that is
# heated from below and cooled from above, whereas all other
# parts of the boundary are insulated (i.e., no heat flux through
# these boundaries; this is also often used to specify symmetry
# boundaries).

# The final part is to specify what ASPECT should do with the
# solution once computed at the end of every time step. The
# process of evaluating the solution is called `postprocessing'
# and we choose to compute velocity and temperature statistics,

# visualization. These output files are created every time
# a time step crosses time points separated by 1e7 years.
