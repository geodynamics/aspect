############### Parameters describing the model
# Let us choose a box domain (400 km wide and 100 km in depth)
# where we fix the temperature at the bottom and top,
# allow inflow from the bottom and outflow on the left and right,
# and prescribe the velocity along the top using the
# `function' description.

# We fix the temperature at the top, representing the Earth's
# surface, and at the bottom, where material flows in and we

# The velocity along the top boundary models a spreading
# center of a mid-ocean ridge. The horizontal component of
# the velocity is presribed on both side boundaries to
# cause flow away from the spreading center, while the

# freely based on the pressure in the model. The bottom
# boundary is left open so that material can flow in.

# refined further (i.e., it remains static) throughout the model
