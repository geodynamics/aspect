############### Parameters describing the model
# Let us choose a box domain (400 km wide and 200 km in depth)
# where we fix the temperature at the bottom and top,
# allow free slip along the bottom, left and right,
# and prescribe the velocity along the top using the
# `function' description.

# In this model we want material to be able to (1) flow in freely
# through the base, (2) flow freely in the horizontal direction
# through the left and right walls where the vertical velocity is 0,
# and (3) have a velocity of zero at the top boundary. This is
# achieved through a combination of velocity and pressure boundary
# conditions, where only the vertical (y) component of the velocity
# is set to 0 on the left and right walls, while the x and y velocity
# are both set to zero on the top boundary.

# also set to the initial lithostatic pressure, which enables horizontal
