# This is a test model of 2D dike-injection box to determine that the
# dilation term is working prepoerly.
# Material is injected in the left half of the model domain with a rate
# that corresponds to a velocity divergence of 1e-5 1/yr and can flow
# out through the right-side boundaries. This corresponds to a linear
# velocity increase from 0 to 500 m * 1e-5 1/yr = 5e-3 m/yr in the right
# half of the domain.
