# This is a test model of 2D dike-injection box to determine that the
# latent heating term in the energy equation corresponding to dilation 
# terms in the Stokes equations is working prepoerly.
# In the injection area, the latent heat release upon crystallization 
# (H_crys) and associated with injection melt ((T_inj-T)*rho*Cp, where
# T_inj the temperature of injected melt, T, rho, Cp are temperature,
# density and specific heat) is:
#
#   (H_crys + (T_inj - T) * rho * Cp) * injection rate
#   (1e9 + (1273 - 273) * 1000 * 1000) J/m^3 * 1e-5 1/yr 
#   =  2e4 J/m^3/yr = 0.633e-3 J/m^3/s
