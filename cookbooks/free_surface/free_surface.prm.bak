# This is a very simple cookbook which demonstrates the use of a free surface
# for computing surface topography. The model is a 2D box, with a rising blob
# beneath a free surface that generates an initially increasing and then
# decaying surface topography while its heat diffuses. We output the maximum
# and minimum topography at every time step to document the evolution of
# topography.

# Free surface calculations are typically more difficult to stabilize, and tend

# the initial time steps to a smaller size (1000 years, and we allow each time
# step to only grow by 30% compared to the last one to avoid jumps in time step
# length). We could also reduce the CFL number to decrease all time steps, but
# that would slow down the whole model instead of just the first time steps.
