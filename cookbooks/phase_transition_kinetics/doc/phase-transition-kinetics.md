## Overview

This cookbook demonstrates how to model phase transitions in a simple subduction model using reaction kinetics driven by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. This [`PhaseTransitionKinetics`](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/blob/main/cookbooks/phase_transition_kinetics/phase-transition-kinetics.h) material model differs from existing material models in `ASPECT` that apply the [`PhaseFunction`](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/blob/4a0743e738e65c3c8b371b4e8579e304f855ec0d/include/aspect/material_model/utilities.h#L756) class (e.g., see the [Convection in a 2d box with a phase transition](https://aspect-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/cookbooks/cookbooks/christensen_yuen_phase_function/doc/christensen_yuen_phase_function.html) cookbook), which assumes phase transitions proceed over a finite depth (or pressure) interval under hydrostatic conditions after {cite:t}`christensen:yuen:1985`. As an alternative approach, the `PhaseTransitionKinetics` material model uses operator splitting to govern phase transitions under non-hydrostatic conditions---in this cookbook we focus on the olivine &rarr; wadsleyite reaction. In this simple subduction example, cold material flows from the top boundary of a 300 $\times$ 200 km 2D box at a fixed temperature and velocity. The top part of the model consists of pure olivine, which becomes metastable as it flows downwards into the wadsleyite stability field. In this cookbook we ignore the reverse wadsleyite &rarr olivine reaction because the mantle flow is unidirectional.

Rather than explicitly prescribing a univariant reaction boundary as in the `PhaseFunction` class, the `PhaseTransitionKinetics` material model formulates the phase transition as a function of the excess Gibbs free energy relative to an adiabatic reference state:

```{math}
:label: eqn:driving-force

\Delta G = \Delta G_0 + \hat{P} \Delta V - \hat{T} \Delta S
```

where $\Delta G$ is excess Gibbs free energy driving the phase transition, $\Delta G_0 = \Delta G_b - \Delta G_a$ is the difference in Gibbs free energy between the reacting phases $a$ and $b$, $\Delta V = V_b - V_a$ and $\Delta S = S_b - S_a$ are the differences in molar volume and entropy of the phases, respectively, $\hat{P} = P - \bar{P}$ is the nonadiabatic ("dynamic") pressure, and $\hat{T} = T - \bar{T}$ is the nonadiabatic temperature. The thermodynamic variables $\Delta G_0$, $\Delta V$, and $\Delta S$ are evaluated along an isentropic adiabat ($\bar{P}$, $\bar{T}$) using the thermodynamic data and equations of state from {cite:t}`stixrude:lithgow-bertelloni:2011`. These thermodynamic data are stored in the table [`ol-wad-driving-force-profile.txt`](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/blob/main/cookbooks/phase_transition_kinetics/thermodynamic-driving-force-profile-olivine-wadsleyite.txt), which is referenced using the [`AsciiDataProfile`](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/blob/a947bac5a92025ed0f12bf4da70757e78a531b25/include/aspect/structured_data.h#L717) class. Figure {numref}`fig:ascii-data-profile` shows contours of the thermodynamic driving force $\Delta G$ as a function of depth and the degree of local dynamic pressure $\hat{P}$ and heating $\hat{T}$.

```{figure-md} fig:ascii-data-profile
<img src="thermodynamic-driving-force-olivine-wadsleyite.*" style="width:80.0%" />

Thermodynamic driving force for the reaction olivine &rarr; wadsleyite as a function of depth. The pressure- and temperature-dependent terms in Equation {math:numref}`eqn:driving-force` are shown in (a) and (b), respectively, with the other term held fixed. The $\Delta G = 0$ contour indicates thermodynamic equilibrium. The olivine &rarr; wadsleyite reaction begins when $\Delta G$ is negative (purple contours) and no reaction occurs where $\Delta G$ is positive (orange contours). At a fixed depth, positive dynamic pressure $\hat{P}$ tends to drive the olivine &rarr; wadsleyite reaction, while excess local heating (positive $\hat{T}$) tends to hinder it. $\Delta G_0$, $\Delta V$, and $\Delta S$ for olivine and wadsleyite were computed with the mineral physics toolkit `BurnMan` {cite}`myhill:etal:2023` using thermodynamic data and equations of state from {cite:t}`stixrude:lithgow-bertelloni:2011`.
```

The reaction rate is then calculated as:

```{math}
:label: eqn:reaction-rate

\frac{dX}{dt} =
  \begin{cases}
    0, & \text{if } \Delta G > 0 \text{ or } X \geq 1 \\
    Q \, \Delta G \, (1 - X), & \text{if } \Delta G < 0 \text{ and } X < 1
  \end{cases}
```

where $Q$ is a kinetic prefactor constant (units: mol/J/s) and $X$ is the mass fraction of phase $b$ (the product phase). The simple subduction models below show a metastable olivine layer forming with a thickness that varies from $\leq$ 10–15 km for $Q$ = 1e$^{-9}$ mol/J/s (Figure {numref}`fig:simple-subduction-Q9`) to $\leq$ 35–40 km for $Q$ = 1e$^{-10}$ mol/J/s (Figure {numref}`fig:simple-subduction-Q10`). Virtually no metastable olivine layer forms for $Q \leq$ 1e$^{-8}$ because the reaction rate $dX/dt$ is too high relative to the advection timestep in the simulation (i.e., the phases are always in equilibrium).

```{figure-md} fig:simple-subduction-Q9
<img src="simple-subduction-Q9-evolution.*" style="width:80.0%" />

Evolution of a simple subduction model with an olivine &rarr; wadsleyite phase transition and a kinetic prefactor $Q$ of 1e$^{-9}$. Cold material flows from the top boundary at a fixed temperature and velocity (left column) and olivine transforms to wadsleyite (center column). The phase transition is governed by a reaction rate driven by non-equilibrium thermodynamics (Equation {math:numref}`eqn:reaction-rate`). A high-density metastable wadsleyite layer and a low-density metastable olivine layer form above and below the equilibrium reaction boundary, respectively (right column). The morphology and sharpness of the phase transition layer develop dynamically as the reaction rate responds to changes in non-hydrostatic ("dynamic") pressure and local heating.

```

## Assumptions and limitations

The `PhaseTransitionKinetics` material model assumes that reactions begin at univariant PT boundaries and proceed until the metastable phase is entirely absent (i.e., $\Delta G \leq$ 0 until $X$ = either 0 or 1). This implies that there are no divariant PT fields where the reacting phases (or mineral assemblages) remain in equilibrium by adjusting their volume fractions or bulk compositions. The `PhaseTransitionKinetics` material model also does not account for latent heat of reaction, which would affect the reaction rate through the $\hat{T}$ term in Equation {math:numref}`eqn:driving-force` {cite}`{e.g.,}schmeling:etal:1999`. Thus, the `PhaseTransitionKinetics` material model is not intended to be used with other material models that use lookup tables (e.g., the [`Steinberger`](https://aspect-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/cookbooks/cookbooks/steinberger/doc/steinberger.html) material model) or the `PhaseFunction` class (e.g., the [`Latent heat`](https://aspect-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/cookbooks/cookbooks/latent-heat/doc/latent-heat.html#latent-heat-benchmark) material model). Rather, the utility of the `PhaseTransitionKinetics` material model is to explore feedbacks between mantle dynamics and reaction kinetics, the morphology and PT-dependence of metastable mantle boundary layers, and their implications for and seismic structure and mantle flow.

The `PhaseTransitionKinetics` material model also ignores the dependence of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\text{Cp}$ on the reaction rate (i.e., the "metamorphic" terms in equations 7, 9, and 10 of {cite:t}`stixrude:lithgow-bertelloni:2022`). Instead, it computes $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\text{Cp}$ as the arithmetic average using the mass fractions of olivine and wadsleyite (i.e., the "isomorphic" terms in equations 7, 9, and 10 of {cite:t}`stixrude:lithgow-bertelloni:2022`). Our model therefore underestimates the effective bulk $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\text{Cp}$.

Moreover, Equations {math:numref}`eqn:driving-force` and {math:numref}`eqn:reaction-rate` define a simple linear model that relates macro-scale thermodynamics to reaction rates. One could also consider adding other terms to the right-hand-side of Equation {math:numref}`eqn:reaction-rate` that scale micro-scale reaction mechanisms to macro-scale reaction rates, such as Avrami-type equations {cite}`avrami:1939,devaux:etal:2000,guest:etal:2003,guest:etal:2004`. These alternative formulations could introduce strong feedbacks between mantle flow and reaction rates, especially if the reaction rate equation is stress-dependent {cite}`liu:etal:1998,wheeler:2018`. Testing different reaction rate models is as simple as swapping out Equation {math:numref}`eqn:reaction-rate` in `PhaseTransitionKinetics` for another expression, thereby extending the functionality of the `PhaseTransitionKinetics` to include other models of reaction kinetics.

The adiabatic conditions are computed from the initial composition model, which defines a two-layered mantle with olivine at depths above 110 km (from the base of the model), and wadsleyite below. The composition field `X_field` stores the amount of wadsleyite and is updated by the reaction rate $dX/dt$ with a separate "reaction" timestep that is smaller than the advection timestep (see {ref}`sec:benchmark:operator-splitting`). We use the projected density approximation {cite}`gassmoller:etal:2020` formulation of the continuity equation, which requires a prescribed `density_field`

The `PhaseTransitionKinetic` material model that requires a data file that contains columns for pressure, temperature, $\rho_a$, $\rho_b$, $\alpha_a$, $\alpha_b$, $\text{Cp}_a$, $\text{Cp}_b$, $\Delta G$, $\Delta V$, and $\Delta S$ for a reaction of interest. The data file can optionally store seismic wave velocities and their temperature-derivatives. The thermodynamic data profile could represent a reaction between polymorphic phases as demonstrated in this cookbook, or it could represent a reaction between two fixed mineral assemblages. The kinetic prefactor $Q$ scales the reaction rate according to Equation {math:numref}`eqn:reaction-rate`
