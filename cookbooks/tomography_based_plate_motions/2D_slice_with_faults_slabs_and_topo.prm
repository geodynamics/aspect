# This cookbook demonstrates how to set up instantaneous mantle flow models
# using available geophysical constraints. To avoid a large computational cost,
# this model is a 2D spherical shell with imposed zones of weakness at plate boundaries
# and internal buoyancy forces arising from observed mantle heterogeneity that drive flow.
# The generated mantle flow field at the surface can be compared with the observed
# surface deformation and the fit can be used to constrain the physical state
# of the mantle. However, a self-consistent comparison with observe plate velocities requires
# transitioning from a 2D shell to a 3D sphere, following the approach in Saxena et al. (2023).
# We define the location of plate boundaries and Cratons using the Geodynamic World Builder.
# This .prm file is based on the existing .prm file, '2D_slice_with_faults_and_cratons.prm',
# that describes the initial and boundary conditions, along with additional details on
# the material model. In particular, this .prm file adds the detailed slab structures
# and the initial topography in the models.

# The material model uses diffusion/dislocation creep with prefactors, activation

# diffusion/dislocation creep in the upper mantle and transition zone, and diffusion
# creep as the dominant deformation mechanism in the lower mantle.
# Additionally, all the viscosity variations are laterally averaged to a 1D viscosity
# profile with an additional layer between 660 and 800 km depth, referred to as
# the mid-mantle viscosity. We do not scale viscosity within the slabs to avoid
# weak slabs in the asthenosphere using the parameter :
# 'Use asthenosphere viscosity scaling in cold regions'. The trench zone weakness
# defines the low-viscosity layer above the slabs.
# More details on the chosen material model parameters are in
