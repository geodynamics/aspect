# This cookbook demonstrates how we can set up instantaneous mantle flow models
# using available geophysical constraints. To avoid large computational cost,
# this model is a 2D spherical shell with imposed plate boundaries and driven
# by mantle forces arising from observed mantle heterogeneity.
# The generated mantle flow field at the surface can be compared with the observed
# surface deformation and the fit can be used to constrain the physical state
# of the mantle.
# We define plate boundaries and cratons using WorldBuilder.
