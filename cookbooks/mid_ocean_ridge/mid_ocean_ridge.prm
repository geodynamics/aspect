# with respect to the ridge axis in the center, we only model one half
# of the ridge.

# Because our model includes melt transport, it is nonlinear and we have to
# use an iterative solver scheme, that iterates between solving the temperature
# composition and Stokes equations.

##################### Melting and freezing ########################

# Because the model includes reactions that might be on a faster time scale
# than the time step of the model (melting and the freezing of melt), we use
# the operator splitting scheme.
set Use operator splitting                     = true

  # Because this model includes strong localized viscosity contrasts we
  # increase the robustness of the solver at the cost of memory consumption.

end

# We use the melt simple material model that includes melting and freezing of
# melt for an average mantle composition that is characteristic for a mid-ocean
# ridge setting, and mainly use its default parameters.
# In particular, we have to define how fast melting and freezing should be.
# We assume that both reactions happen on a time scale of 200 years (or a rate
# of 5e-3/year), which should be substantially shorter than the time step size,
# so that the melt fraction will always be close to equilibrium.
# As the model includes melting and freezing, we do not have to extract any melt.
# We also slightly reduce the dependence of shear viscosity on the melt
# fraction, because the model is relatively coarse and would otherwise develop
# velocity oscillations in the region of highest melt content.

##################### Velocity ########################

# To model the divergent velocitiy field of a mid-ocean ridge, we prescribe

# We use a closed boundary with free slip conditions as the left boundary, which
# marks the ridge axis and also acts as a center line for our model, so that
# material can not cross this boundary.
# We prescribe the velocity at the top boundary using a function:
# At the ridge axis, the velocity is zero, at a distance of 10 km from the ridge
# axis or more, the rigid plate uniformly moves away from the ridge with a constant
# speed, and close to the ridge we interpolate between these two conditions.
