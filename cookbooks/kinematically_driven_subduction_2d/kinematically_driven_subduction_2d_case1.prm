# This cookbook models oceanic subduction in a 2d
# box of 3000 x 670 km.
# The subducting plate is driven by inflow boundary
# conditions on the top part of the right boundary,

# Only density and viscosity differ per composition.
# High resolution is required to sufficiently resolve the weak zone
# between the subducting and overriding plate, and consequently
# 100 MPI processes are required.
