    <h3>
      Installation instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
      In order to install ASPECT, you will need to first install the following
      dependencies:
      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov/">Trilinos</a>: A library for
	parallel linear algebra.
	<li><a href="http://www.p4est.org">p4est</a>: A library for
	parallel data structures and algorithms to represent meshes.
	<li><a href="http://www.dealii.org">deal.II</a>: A library that
	supports all things related to finite element methods.
      </ul>
      The individual steps needed to install each of these packages are
      discussed in the <a href="doc/manual.pdf">Installation instructions
      section of the ASPECT manual</a>.
      Detailed installation instructions are also provided by all of these
      libraries on their webpages as well as <i>much</i> more information
      about details of thse libraries.
    </p>

    <p>
      One you have installed these three underlying libraries, compiling
      ASPECT is relatively simple. More information can again be found in the
      corresponding section of the <a href="doc/manual.pdf">ASPECT manual</a>.
    </p>


    <h3>
      Running and extending ASPECT
    </h3>

    <p>
      Instructions on how to run and extend, as well as on how to interpret
      the output of Apect can also be found in
      the <a href="doc/manual.pdf">ASPECT manual</a>. This manual also
      discusses the structure of the source code.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have questions on ASPECT, there are a number of mailing lists
      that can help:
      <ul>
	<li>For questions on the source code of ASPECT, portability,
	installation, etc., use
	the <a href="mailto:aspect-devel@geodynamics.org">aspect-devel mailing
	    list</a>. Information about this mailing list is provided
	  <a href="http://lists.geodynamics.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/aspect-devel">here</a>. This mailing list is where the ASPECT
	  developers all hang out.

	<li>ASPECT is primarily based on the deal.II library (the dependency
	on Trilinos and p4est is primarily through deal.II, and not directly
	visible in the ASPECT source code). If you have particular questions
	about deal.II, contact
	the <a href="http://www.dealii.org/mail.html">deal.II mailing
	lists</a>.

	<li>In case of more general questions about mantle convection, you can
	contact the <a href="mailto:cig-mc@geodynamics.org">CIG mantle
	convection mailing lists</a>. Information about this mailing list is
	provided <a href="http://geodynamics.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cig-MC">here</a>.

	<li>If you have specific questions about ASPECT that are not suitable
	for public and archived mailing lists, you can contact the
	primary developers:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Wolfgang
	      Bangerth: <a href="mailto:bangerth@math.tamu.edu">bangerth@math.tamu.edu</a>
	    <li>Timo
