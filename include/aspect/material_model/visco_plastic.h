    /**
     * A material model combining viscous and plastic deformation, with
     * the option to also include viscoelastic deformation.
     *
     * Viscous deformation is defined by a viscous flow law describing
     * dislocation and diffusion creep:
     *   $ v = \frac{1}{2}   A^{-\frac{1}{n}} d^{\frac{m}{n}}
     *               \dot{\varepsilon}_{ii}^{\frac{1-n}{n}}
     *               \exp\left(\frac{E + PV}{nRT}\right) $
     * where
     *   where $A$ is the prefactor, $n$ is the stress exponent,
     *   $\dot{\varepsilon}_{ii}$ is the square root of the deviatoric
     *   strain rate tensor second invariant, $d$ is grain size,
     *   $m$ is the grain size exponent, $E$ is activation energy,
     *   $V$ is activation volume, $P$ is pressure, $R$ is the gas
     *   exponent and $T$ is temperature.
     *
     * One may select to use the diffusion ($v_{diff}$; $n=1$, $m!=0$),
     * dislocation ($v_{disl}$, $n>1$, $m=0$) or composite
     * $\frac{v_{diff}v_{disl}}{v_{diff}+v_{disl}}$ equation form.
     *
     * Viscous stress is limited by plastic deformation, which follows
     * a Drucker Prager yield criterion:
     *  $\sigma_y = C\cos(\phi) + P\sin(\phi)$  (2D)
     * or in 3D
     *  $\sigma_y = \frac{6C\cos(\phi) + 2P\sin(\phi)}{\sqrt{3}(3+\sin(\phi))}$
     * where
     *   $\sigma_y$ is the yield stress, $C$ is cohesion, $phi$ is the angle
     *   of internal friction and $P$ is pressure.
     * If the viscous stress ($2v{\varepsilon}_{ii})$) exceeds the yield
     * stress ($\sigma_{y}$), the viscosity is rescaled back to the yield
     * surface: $v_{y}=\sigma_{y}/(2{\varepsilon}_{ii})$
     *
     * When included, the viscoelastic rheology takes into account the elastic shear
     * strength (e.g., shear modulus), while the tensile and volumetric
     * strength (e.g., Young's and bulk modulus) are not considered. The model
     * is incompressible and allows specifying an arbitrary number of
     * compositional fields, where each field represents a different rock type
     * or component of the viscoelastic stress tensor. The symmetric stress tensor in
     * 2D and 3D, respectively, contains 3 or 6 components. The compositional fields
     * representing these components must be named and listed in a very specific
     * format, which is designed to minimize mislabeling stress tensor components
     * as distinct 'compositional rock types' (or vice versa). For 2D models,
     * 3+3 consecutive compositional fields must be labeled ve_stress_xx, ve_stress_yy
     * ve_stress_xy, ve_stress_xx_old, ve_stress_yy_old, ve_stress_xy_old.
     * In 3D, six consecutive compositional fields must be labeled
     * ve_stress_xx, ve_stress_yy, ve_stress_zz, ve_stress_xy, ve_stress_xz, ve_stress_yz,
     * ve_stress_xx_old, ve_stress_yy_old, ve_stress_zz_old, ve_stress_xy_old,
     * ve_stress_xz_old, ve_stress_yz_old.
     *
     * Combining this viscoelasticity implementation with non-linear viscous flow
     * and plasticity produces a constitutive relationship commonly referred to
     * as partial elastoviscoplastic (e.g., pEVP) in the geodynamics community.
     * While extensively discussed and applied within the geodynamics literature,
     * notable references include:
     * Moresi et al. (2003), J. Comp. Phys., v. 184, p. 476-497.

     *
     * The overview below directly follows Moresi et al. (2003) eqns. 23-32.
     * However, an important distinction between this material model and
     * the studies above is the option to use compositional fields, rather than
     * particles, to track individual components of the viscoelastic stress
     * tensor. Calculating viscoelastic stresses with particles is also implemented,
     * and can be switched on by using particles with the particle property
     * 'elastic stress'.
     * Moresi et al. (2003) begins (eqn. 23) by writing the deviatoric
     * rate of deformation ($\hat{D}$) as the sum of elastic
     * ($\hat{D_{e}}$) and viscous ($\hat{D_{v}}$) components:
     * $\hat{D} = \hat{D_{e}} + \hat{D_{v}}$.
     * These terms further decompose into
     * $\hat{D_{v}} = \frac{\tau}{2\eta}$ and
     * $\hat{D_{e}} = \frac{\overset{\triangledown}{\tau}}{2\mu}$, where
     * $\tau$ is the viscous deviatoric stress, $\eta$ is the shear viscosity,
     * $\mu$ is the shear modulus and $\overset{\triangledown}{\tau}$ is the
     * Jaumann corotational stress rate. If plasticity is included the
     * deviatoric rate of deformation may be written as:
     * $\hat{D} = \hat{D_{e}} + \hat{D_{v}} + \hat{D_{p}}$, where $\hat{D_{p}}$
     * is the plastic component. As defined in the second paragraph, $\hat{D_{p}}$
     * decomposes to $\frac{\tau_{y}}{2\eta_{y}}$, where $\tau_{y}$ is the yield
     * stress and $\eta_{y}$ is the viscosity rescaled to the yield surface.
     *
     * Above, the Jaumann corotational stress rate (eqn. 24) from the elastic
     * component contains the time derivative of the deviatoric stress ($\dot{\tau}$)
     * and terms that  account for material spin (e.g., rotation) due to advection:
     * $\overset{\triangledown}{\tau} = \dot{\tau} + {\tau}W -W\tau$.
     * Above, $W$ is the material spin tensor (eqn. 25):
     * $W_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left (\frac{\partial V_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} -
     * \frac{\partial V_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} \right )$.
     *
     * The Jaumann stress-rate can also be approximated using terms from the time
     * at the previous time step ($t$) and current time step ($t + \Delta t^{e}$):
     * $\smash[t]{\overset{\triangledown}{\tau}}^{t + \Delta t^{e}} \approx
     * \frac{\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e} - \tau^{t}}}{\Delta t^{e}} -
     * W^{t}\tau^{t} + \tau^{t}W^{t}$.
     * In this material model, the size of the time step above ($\Delta t^{e}$)
     * can be specified as the numerical time step size or an independent fixed time
     * step. If the latter case is selected, a stress averaging scheme is applied
     * to account for the differences between the numerical
     * and fixed elastic time step (eqn. 32). A fixed computational time
     * step throughout the model run can be achieved by using a large CFL number and
     * smaller maximum time step values that restrict the numerical time step to a specific value.
     *
     * The formulation above allows rewriting the total rate of deformation (eqn. 29) as
     * $\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e}} = \eta_{eff} \left (
     * 2\hat{D}^{t + \triangle t^{e}} + \frac{\tau^{t}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} +
     * \frac{W^{t}\tau^{t} - \tau^{t}W^{t}}{\mu}  \right )$.
     *
     * The effective viscosity (eqn. 28) is a function of the viscosity ($\eta$),
     * elastic time step size ($\Delta t^{e}$) and shear relaxation time
     * ($ \alpha = \frac{\eta}{\mu} $):
     * $\eta_{eff} = \eta \frac{\Delta t^{e}}{\Delta t^{e} + \alpha}$
     * The magnitude of the shear modulus thus controls how much the effective
     * viscosity is reduced relative to the initial viscosity.
     *
     * Elastic effects are introduced into the governing Stokes equations through
     * an elastic force term (eqn. 30 updated to the term in eqn. 5 in Farrington et al. 2014)
     * using stresses from the previous time step rotated and advected into the current
     * time step:
     * $F^{e,t} = -\frac{\eta_{eff}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} \tau^{0adv}$.
     * This force term is added onto the right-hand side force vector in the
     * system of equations.
     *
     * Several model parameters (reference densities, thermal expansivities
     * thermal diffusivities, heat capacities and rheology parameters) can
     * be defined per-compositional field.
     * For each material parameter the user supplies a comma delimited list of
     * length N+1, where N is the number of compositional fields.  The
     * additional field corresponds to the value for background material.  They
     * should be ordered ``background, composition1, composition2...''
     *
     * If a list of values is given for the density, thermal expansivity,
     * thermal diffusivity and heat capacity, the volume weighted sum of the
     * values of each of the compositional fields is used in their place,
     * for example $\rho = \sum \left( \rho_i V_i \right)$
     *
     * The individual output viscosities for each compositional field are
     * also averaged. The user can choose from a range of options for this
     * viscosity averaging. If only one value is given for any of these parameters,
     * all compositions are assigned the same value.
     * The first value in the list is the value assigned to "background material"
     * (regions where the sum of the compositional fields is < 1.0).
