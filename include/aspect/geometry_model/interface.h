         *
         * Computing a depth requires a geometry model to define a
         * "vertical" direction. For example, the Box model considers
         * the $(0,1)^T$ vector in 2d (and the $(0,0,1)^T$ vector in
         * 3d) as vertical and considers the "top" boundary as the
         * "surface". Similarly, the spherical shell takes the radial
         * vector as "vertical" and the outer boundary as "surface".
         * In most cases, how geometry models define "vertical" and
         * "surface" will be intuitive and obvious. In almost all
         * cases one will use a gravity model that also matches these

         * @note Implementations of this function in derived classes can
         * only compute the depth with regard to the <i>reference

         * created. If you are using a dynamic topography in your models
         * that changes in every time step, or if you apply initial
         * topography to your model, then the <i>actual</i> depth
         * of a point with regard to this dynamic topography will not
         * match the value this function returns. This is so because
         * computing the actual depth is difficult: In parallel computations,
         * the processor on which you want to evaluate the depth of a point
         * may know nothing about the displacement of the surface anywhere
         * if it happens to store only interior cells. Furthermore, it is

         * The distance to the closest surface point? The vertical distance
         * to the surface point directly above? Or the length of the line
         * from the given point to a surface point that is locally always
         * parallel to the gravity vector? For all of these reasons, this
         * function simply returns the geometric vertical depth of a point

         * surface that defines what zero depth is.
