      /**
       * This class declares the public interface of visualization
       * postprocessors. Visualization postprocessors are used to compute
       * derived data, e.g. wave speeds, friction heating terms, etc, to be
       * put into graphical output files. They are plugins for the
       * aspect::Postprocess::Visualization class.
       *
       * Classes derived from this type must implement the functions that save
       * the state of the object and restore it (for checkpoint/restart
       * capabilities) as well as functions that declare and read parameters.
       * However, this class also already provides default implementations of
       * these functions that simply do nothing. This is appropriate for
       * objects that are stateless, as is commonly the case for visualization
       * postprocessors.
       *
       * Access to the data of the simulator is granted by the @p protected
       * member functions of the SimulatorAccess class, i.e., classes
       * implementing this interface will in general want to derive from both
       * this Interface class as well as from the SimulatorAccess class.
       *
       * <h3> How visualization plugins work </h3>
       *
       * There are two ways in which visualization plugins can work to get
       * data from a simulation into an output file:
       * <ul>
       * <li> Classes derived from this class can also derive from the deal.II
       * class DataPostprocessor or any of the classes like
       * DataPostprocessorScalar or DataPostprocessorVector. These classes can
       * be thought of as filters: DataOut will call a function in them for
       * every cell and this function will transform the values or gradients
       * of the solution and other information such as the location of
       * quadrature points into the desired quantity to output. A typical case
       * would be if the quantity $g(x)$ you want to output can be written as
       * a function $g(x) = G(u(x),\nabla u(x), x, ...)$ in a point-wise sense
       * where $u(x)$ is the value of the solution vector (i.e., the
       * velocities, pressure, temperature, etc) at an evaluation point. In
       * the context of this program an example would be to output the density
       * of the medium as a spatially variable function since this is a
       * quantity that for realistic media depends point-wise on the values of
       * the solution.
       *
       * Using this way of describing a visualization postprocessor will yield
       * a class  that would then have the following base classes:
       * - aspect::Postprocess::VisualizationPostprocessors::Interface
       * - aspect::SimulatorAccess
       * - dealii::DataPostprocessor or any of the other ones listed above
       *
       * <li> The second possibility is for a class to not derive from
       * dealii::DataPostprocessor but instead from the CellDataVectorCreator
       * class. In this case, a visualization postprocessor would generate and
       * return a vector that consists of one element per cell. The intent of
       * this option is to output quantities that are not point-wise functions
       * of the solution but instead can only be computed as integrals or
       * other functionals on a per-cell basis. A typical case would be error
       * estimators that do depend on the solution but not in a point-wise
       * sense; rather, they yield one value per cell of the mesh. See the
       * documentation of the CellDataVectorCreator class for more
       * information.
       * </ul>
