Parameters read by needlet_tool:

mode (string):
  split:
      a single a_lm file is input and split into needlet bands
  assemble:
      multiple needlet bands are read and combined into a single a_lm file
  write_coefficients:
      needlet coefficients are written to a FITS file

needlet_type (string):
  needatool: use needlets as defined by Pietrobon et al., ApJ 723, 1 (2010),
             following the construction in section 3
  cosine   : use needlets as defined by Basak et al., MNRAS 419, 1163 (2012),
             following the equations in section 3
  sdw      : use needlets as defined by Leistedt et al., A&A 558, A128 (2013),
             following equations 10 to 15
  spline   : use B-spline based wavelets, similar to those defined by Starck et
             al., A&A 446, 1191 (2006), but with band number ascending towards
             higher resolutions.

if (needlet_type=="cosine"):
  llim: string
    For n bands, this list must contain n+2 comma-separated integers:
      - start of band 1
      - start of band 2 == peak of band 1
      - start of band 3 == peak of band 2 == end of band 1
      [...]
      - start of band n == peak of band n-1 == end of band n-2
      - peak of band n == end of band n-1
      - end of band n
    The values must be strictly increasing, with the exception of the first and
    second value, which may both be 0.
else
  B (double):
    B parameter for the respective needlet
    The window for the nth band peaks at l=B^n.
endif

minband, maxband (integer):
  the minimum and maximum needlet scales requested for the operation

if (mode=="write_coefficients"):
  outfile_needlets(string): output file name root for needlet coefficients
else
  infile (string):
    if mode=="split"   : input file containing the a_lm
    if mode=="assemble": root name for the input a_lm files
                         Full names are "<infile>###.fits",
                         where ### is the three-digit number of the band

  outfile (string):
    if mode=="split"   : root name for the output a_lm files
                         Full names are "<outfile>###.fits",
                         where ### is the three-digit number of the band
    if mode=="assemble": output file containing the assembled a_lm

  polarisation (bool, default=false):
    if false, only the intensity a_lm are processed,
    if true, the code currently exits with an error message,
    since polarisation is not yet supported.
endif

double_precision (bool, default=false):
  if false, a_lm are read/written in single precision,
  otherwise in double precision.



General remarks on the code
===========================

In contrast to most other needlet-related codes, needlet_tool does not read and
write map data, but spherical harmonic coefficients. This is done because
 - the code is then independent of a particular pixelisation.
 - the necessary transforms between map and spherical harmonic domain are
   subject to many complications (like choice of band limits, removal of low
   multipoles, masking, pixel weighting, iterative map analysis, choice of
   resolution for the output maps, etc.) so that it would be cumbersome to
   reproduce all these details in needlet_tool.
 - the separation of the transforms and needlet operations does not degrade
   overall performance, so it is just as efficient to let the SHTs be done by
   dedicated codes like anafast/synfast etc.

Splitting and then reassembling a set of a_lm should accurately reproduce the
input a_lm at all l starting from the first peak (which is 1 for "needatool" and
"sdw" needlets, but may be different for "cosine" wavelets).
The remaining information in the input data (monopole for "needatool" and "sdw",
part of the coefficients below the first peak for "cosine") is currently
discarded, but could also be written to an additional output file.
