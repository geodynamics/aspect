# This test ensures that the PerpleX lookup material model works
# with compositional fields enabled

# WARNING: Please understand that the PerpleX Lookup material model is only a
# proof-of-concept; the number of P-T-X evaluations is extremely large, which
# means that ASPECT will be interminably slow for any real problems.

# KLB composition in the CFMAS system
# The bulk composition is given by five compositional fields
# which correspond to the components in the PerpleX input
# file (in this case, SiO2, Al2O3, FeO and MgO).
# As defined in the PerpleX input file, the composition is
# given in weight amount. The total amount is normalized
# by the PerpleX routines, so it doesn't need to equal 1 or 100.
