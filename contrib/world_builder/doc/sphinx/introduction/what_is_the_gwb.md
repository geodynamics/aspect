What is the GWB?
================

The geodynamic models can be divided in **three broad classes**. 

1. **Simple synthetic models:**

   This class which involve simplistic geometries for generic modeling and are easy to make and parameterize. These are god for simplified problems and benchmarks.
2. **Data driven models:**

   This class which consists of initial conditions (semi-)automatically derived from datasets like tomography.  These are often used for instantaneous models. 
3. **Complex synthetic models:**

   The case which blends complex 3d interpretation driven detailed geometrical features and thermal fields. This can be useful to parameterize instantaneous models or make setups for models starting in the past.

**The GWB has been designed to make the third case a *lot* easier**, but can also be used to design simple synthetic models and in currently work is being done to also be able to integrate datasets in a way which aligns with the GWB design philosophies.

Besides setting up initial conditions for geodynamic models, the GWB can also be used to make detailed 3D visualizations of geologic and geodynamic settings (see {ref}`part:user_manual:chap:how_to_use_the_apps:sec:gwb-grid_app`)
