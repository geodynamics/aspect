# by using a new material model that fixes all of the material
# constants to 1, except for the thermal expansivity and the viscosity,
# which is set to Di, and the density profile, which depends on Di and
# gamma.
# For the Boussinesq case, Di=0 and gamma=infinity, and all parameters
# are constant, except for the density, which depends on the temperature.
