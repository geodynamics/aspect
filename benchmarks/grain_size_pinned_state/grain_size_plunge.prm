# A test for the grain size material model using pinned state damage formulation.
# This test is like tests/grain_size_strain_pinned_state.prm, but uses the parameters
# from Mulyukova and Bercovici (2018) at constant
# temperature and stress in their Figure 4.

# The output can be compared to the analytical solution computed in the
# grain_size_plunge.ipynb notebook located in the same folder as this input file.
