# This parameter file constructs a 3D cube which is rotated around its vertical axis and sheared in the
# xz-plane. It is adapted from Farrington et al. 2014 (Geophysics, Geochemistry, Geosystems), section "3.4.
# Torsion Test in 3-D". According to the authors this is essentially an extension of the simple shear test
# (see the viscoelastic_plastic_simple_shear benchmark prm file) into the third dimension.
# While the model always rotates with a constant rate of 42/360 per unit time, shearing is only applied until
# t = 0.5. At this point the shearing velocity is reduced to zero, and elastic stresses relax.
# For t < 0.5 the analytical expression of the stress is given by:
#   tau = exp(-mu/eta*t)*(C2*cos(V*t/h)-C1*sin(V*t/h))-C2
# and for t >= 0.5:
#   tau = exp(-mu/eta*tmax)*(C2*cos(V*tmax/h)-C1*sin(V*tmax/h))-C2)*exp(-mu/eta*(t-tmax))
# with:
#   tmax = 0.5 [s]     # time at which shearing stops
#   eta = 100  [Pa s]  # the shear viscosity
#   mu  = 100  [Pa]    # the shear modulus
#   V = 0.3    [m/s]   # the shearing velocity
#   h = 1      [m]     # the height of the box
#   omega = 42 [deg/s] # the rotation rate
#   C1 = -(V^2*eta^2*mu)/(mu^2*h^2+V^2*eta^2)
#   C2 = -(V*h*eta*mu^2)/(mu^2*h^2+V^2*eta^2)
#
# These analytical stresses can be directly compared to the xz-component of the stress output (in the composition
# statistics) from this parameter file.
# Farrington et al., however, look at the stresses in an unrotated frame (their Fig. 1b), in which case both
# the analytical stress and the ASPECT stress component need to be multiplied with cos(omega*t). Note that in the
# Farrington paper the vertical axis is the y-axis, such that their stress component xy is ASPECT's stress
# component xz.
# With the time step size given in this parameter file, stresses are underestimated compared to the analytical
# solution by about 0.9% for t < 0.5 and about 2% for t > 0.5. The fit of the numerical stress to the analytical
# solution can be enhanced by choosing a smaller time step size.
