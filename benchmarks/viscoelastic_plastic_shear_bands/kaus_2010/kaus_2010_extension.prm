# This parameter file examines shear band development in a viscoelastic-plastic
# medium that contains a weak viscous inclusion. The experiment is based
# directly on the setup used in Kaus, 2010, Tectonophysics, v. 484, p. 36-47.
# This paper examines both compressional and extensional test cases, and this
# parameter file examines the extensional case. One notable exception to the
# Kaus et al. models and this setup is the lack of cohesion strain-softerning,
# which helps localize deformation along the shear bands.
#
# The key feature of the model is the inclusion of viscoelasticity,
# which leads to a gradual (as opposed to instantaneous for visco-plasticity)
# development of the plastic shear bands above the weak viscous inclusion.
# Kaus (2010) and many other studies (e.g., Glerum et al. 2018, Solid Earth)
# have shown that the shear band angle is directly dependent on the mesh
# resolution. Here, the model contains a very coarse resolution of 100x25
# grid points (0.4 km grid spacing. Increasing the "Initial global refinement"
# parameter from 0 to 1 or 2 (resolution increases by 2x or 4x) should lead
# to an increase in the shear band angle from 45 degrees to close to 60
# degrees. Additional key features of the model include the use of the
# Newton solver for improved nonlinear solver convergence and a plastic
# damper term (Duretz et al., 2019) to provide a quasi length-scale
# and smoother viscosity for plastic shear bands.
