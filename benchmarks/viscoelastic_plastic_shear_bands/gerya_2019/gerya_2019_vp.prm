# Shortening of a visco-plastic block in the absence of gravity
# modified from Exercise 13.2 in Gerya 2019 (Introduction to
# Numerical Geodynamic Modeling). The benchmark has been modified
# to remove viscoelasticity and use slightly different geometries
# for different materials, which allows the edges of features to
# always align with the edges of the mesh with additional global
# refinements. The viscoelastic-plastic version of this setup is
# provided by gerya_2019_vep.prm within this folder.
#
# In detail, the benchmark examines shortening of a viscoelastic
# plastic (here, visco-plastic) block, which contains a weak
# inclusion in the center and a weak medium layer (i.e., sticky
# air) on the top and bottom. The thickness of the weak layers
# and dimensions of the square inclusion have also been modified
# so that element edges always align with these material interfaces
# for uniformly refined meshes of level 3 and up. The velocity on
# the boundaries is 5e-9 m/s, giving a background strain rate of
# 1e-13 1/s. The weak medium and weak inclusion have the following
# material properties: viscosity = 1e17 Pa s, cohesion = 1e7 Pa,
# and internal friction angle = 0. The visco-plastic block has
# the following material properties: viscosity = 1e23 Pa s,
# cohesion = 1e8 Pa, and internal friction angle = 37 degrees.
# Gravity is set to zero and the average pressure is required
# to be equal to zero.
