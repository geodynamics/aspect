# This benchmark examines flexure of a finite-length elastic plate based
# on the setup described in Choi et al., 2013, JGR, v.118, p.2429-2444,
# doi:10.1002/jgrb.50148. The model setup has a 50 km long and 5 km thick
# elastic plate (shear modulus: 30 GPa, viscosity: 1e35 Pa s) overlaying a
# viscous layer (viscosity: 1e17 Pa s, 12.5 km thick), which both have a density
# of 2700 kg/m^3. The top of the model is a free surface, while the bottom
# boundary is zero-slip and the sides are free-slip. The upper right corner
# of the viscous layer is replaced with a low density (1890 kg/m^3) elastic
# block, which drives flexure of the elastic plate (right side goes up, left
# side goes down). The total topography obtained after the model has reached
# equilibrium is 330 m, with -146.5 m and 183.5 m of topography, respectively,
# on the left and right sides. The summed value and profiles differ slightly
# from those reported in Choi et al. (see viscoelastic_plate_flexure.png within
# the doc/ subdirectory of this folder), but closely match more recent experiments
# performed by Cedric Thieulot. The curves from the experiments performed by
# Cedric Thieulot are labeled 'ELEFANT, nelx=150', 'ELEFANT, nelx=250', and
# '100x35'. For further details on these additional experiments, visit:

# The figure in this folder (viscoelastic_plate_flexure.png) was made and
