# This setup models the relaxation of elastic stresses in the absence
# of drivers.
# The analytical solution is:
#     \tau_{xx} = \tau_{xx_{t0}} \exp(-t \frac{\mu}{\eta_{viscous}}),
# where \tau_{xx} is the first component of the stored stress tensor,
# \mu is the shear modulus and \eta_{viscous} the viscous viscosity.
