# Conduction along an adiabat. Initially all material starts on one adiabat
# (at constant entropy), with no material inflow. The adiabatic reference
# profile is computed based on this initial entropy, using a look-up table
# for orthopyroxene, which has one narrow phase transition in the center of
# the model. The temperature is fixed at the top, and the bottom is set as
# an insulating boundary. Consequently, the model should cool down over
# time as heat flows out conductively through the top boundary, eventually
# reaching a constant temperature.
