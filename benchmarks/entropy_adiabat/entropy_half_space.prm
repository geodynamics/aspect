# Conduction in a boundary layer, without adiabatic effects. Initially all
# material starts at a constant temperature. Adiabatic effects are switched
# off by setting the gravity to zero. The temperature is fixed at the top,
# and the bottom is set as an insulating boundary. Consequently, the model
# should cool down over time according to the half-space cooling model.
# The temperature at the end of the model run can be compared to the
# solution of the half-space cooling model given in the compositional
# field "half_space".
# Note that density and specific heat are temperature- and, consequently,
# time-dependent, so the solution might slightly deviate from this
# reference profile.
