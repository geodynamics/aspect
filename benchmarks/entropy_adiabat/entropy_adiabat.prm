# Adiabatic downwelling along a pipe. Initially all material starts on one
# adiabat (at constant entropy), with material inflow on another adiabat (a
# different constant entropy). The adiabatic reference profile is computed for
# this different inflow adiabat so that the difference between adiabatic
# profile and actual profile in the model is expected to go to 0 with time. The
# material data contains a discontinuous phase transition (in
# pressure-temperature space), which would make convergence of this model hard.
# Accurate results in particular for the latent heat effects would be nearly
# impossible if not for the new feature in this benchmark, which is to solve
# the advection-diffusion equation in terms of entropy instead of temperature.
# In pressure-entropy space there is no jump in entropy across the phase
# transition, and the equation can be accurately solved (in fact it is trivial
# for this example as the steady-state solution is at constant entropy
# everywhere in the model once the warmer inflowing material has replaced the
# initial material in the model). The resulting temperature for any given
# pressure-entropy is looked up in the used material data table.

# As a benchmark this model can only test that ASPECT's results are consistent
# with the results of the thermodynamic modeling package that produced the
# entropy-pressure tables for material properties (in this case HeFESTo). This
# test is done by replacing the 'compute entropy profile' adiabatic conditions
# plugin with the 'ascii data' plugin, which will load a precomputed adiabat
# from HeFESTo instead of computing an adiabat inside ASPECT. The disadvantage
# of this approach is of course that it is only possible for those adiabats
# that have been precomputed (in this case one for 1600 K), while the 'compute
# entropy profile' plugin can compute adiabats at arbitrary entropy.
