# Downwelling along a pipe.
# This is a modification of the entropy adiabat example with added diffusion.
# According to Schubert, Turcotte and Olson (part 1, p. 194), the added
# diffusion should only affect the temperature profile above the phase transition.
# Schubert, Turcotte and Olson also give an analytical solution for the
# temperature profile. However, since they do not include adiabatic heating, this
# model does not yield the exact solution from Schubert, Turcotte and Olson.
# Instead, the temperature is slightly cooler below the phase transition due to
# the additional heat conduction along the adiabat.
