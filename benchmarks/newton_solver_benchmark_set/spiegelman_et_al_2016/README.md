The files in this directory can be used to recreate the Spiegelman et al. (2016) flow figures from the Fraters, Bangerth, Thieulot, Glerum and Spakman (G-Cubed, submitted, 2018) paper. Adjust both the metabash.sh and bash.sh files to reflect the parameter search you are interested in and run the metabash script. If you have run exactly the same runs as shown in the paper, you can use the cp_P-minLT-res-it-vel_BV.sh script to recreate the figures in that paper.
