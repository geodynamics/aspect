The files in this directory can be used to recreate the Tosi et al. (2015) benchmark figures from the Fraters, Bangerth, Thieulot, Glerum and Spakman (G-Cubed, submitted, 2018) paper. Adjust both the metabash.sh and bash.sh files to reflect the parameter search you are interested in and run the metabash script. If you have run exactly the same runs as shown in the paper, you can use the gnuplot files in plotfiles to recreate the figures in that paper. This bechmark requires the tosi.cc from the tosi_et_al_2015_gcubed folder in the ASPECT benchmark folder to be installed as a normal material model or manually added to the input files as a shared library.
