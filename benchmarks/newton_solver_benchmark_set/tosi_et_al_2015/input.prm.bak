# The final part is to specify what ASPECT should do with the
# solution once computed at the end of every time step. The
# process of evaluating the solution is called `postprocessing'
# and we choose to compute velocity and temperature statistics,
# statistics about the heat flux through the boundaries of the
# domain, and to generate graphical output files for later
# visualization. These output files are created every time
# a time step crosses time points separated by 0.05. Given
# our start time (0.0) and final time (1.0) this means that
# we will obtain 20 output files.
#
# The statistics file includes the data reported in Tosi et al. (2015):
# - average temperature (temperature statistics)
# - top and bottom Nusselt numbers (heat flux statistics)
# - Vrms over the whole domain (velocity statistics)
# - Vrms along the surface (velocity boundary statistics)
# - Vmax along the surface (velocity boundary statistics)
# - average rate of viscous dissipation (tosi viscous dissipation statistics)
# - average rate of work against gravity (tosi viscous dissipation statistics)
# - percentage error difference work and dissipation (tosi viscous dissipation statistics)
#

# and temperature are produced every 0.05 units of time.
