# The advection benchmark creates a simple, 2d annulus
# with prescribed Stokes flow creating 4 convection cells.
# Various parameters can be changed to test their effect
# on the overall cooling of the model.
#
# See run_all_models.sh for running multiple iterations
# of various parameters in a row.
#
# Also see creates_formatted_tables for grabbing specific
# data points from the log file.

############### Global parameters
# We use a 2d setup. We are only interested in
# advection, so we prescribe a Stokes flow and
# solve only for advection.

############### Parameters describing the model
# We are interested in the flow of heat out of the top
# boundary and how the advection is stabilized. Interesting
# values to look at are in subsection Discretization, which
# control the stabilization directly, as well as thermal
# conductivity which effectively controls the Rayleigh number.
# The thermal conductivity and Rayleigh number are inversely
# proportional.
