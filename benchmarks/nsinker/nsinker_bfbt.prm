# This is the "NSinker" benchmark defined in May et al. (2015,G3) in the
# implementation of Rudi et al., (2017, SIAM J.Sci.Comp.). It creates a number
# of spherical high-viscosity, high-density sinking spheres in a box geometry
# that provide a challenge for the Stokes preconditioner. The difficulty of the
# problem is determined by the number of sinkers and the viscosity contrast
# between sinkers and background.

# In this file, we use the
# weighted BFBT preconditioner introduced by Rudi et al., (2017).
