# This parameter file reproduces a 2D benchmark for viscoelastic deformation
# published in "Numerical modelling of magma dynamics coupled to tectonic
# deformation of lithosphere and crust" by Keller, May and Kaus, 2013,
# Geophys. J. Int., v. 195,  p. 1406-1422. The model setup and results are
# described in detail in section B.2.3 and figure B5.
#
# The benchmark examines bending and unbending (e.g., recovery) of a
# viscoelastic beam surrounded by a less dense and viscous (inelastic) fluid.
# Gravitational forces drive initial bending (elastic strain) of the beam for
# 50 Kyr, which then recovers its shape over ~ 500 Kyr if gravity is turned
# off. The recovery is driven by the accumulated elastic stresses and thus
# provides a basic test for the viscoelasticity implementation.
#
# Compositional fields are used to track the viscoelastic stresses and material
# representing the beam. To improve the accuracy of tracking the beam interface,
# a discontinuous discretization and bound preserving limiter is used for the
# compositional fields. Significantly, the time step is limited to 1 Kyr through
# the "Maximum time step" parameter and a relatively high (0.5) CFL value. Using
# a constant time step ensures the effective (viscoelastic) viscosity of the
# viscoelastic beam and viscous fluid remains constants throughout the model run.
#
# As currently constructed, the model will run for 50 Kyr with a gravitational
# acceleration of 10 m/s^2. To produce unbending of the beam after the model
# has finished, change the parameter "End time" to 500 Kyr and set the
# gravitational acceleration to 0 m/s^2. A restart file is written every 10 Kyr
# and the parameter "Resume computation = auto" specifies that a model should
# restart from a checkpoint file if one is present.
