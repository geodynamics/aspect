# Gravity is vertical and of magnitude 1e8.
# The Rayleigh number is defined as
# $Ra = \frac{\rho g \alpha \Delta_T D^3}{\kappa \eta_0}$,
# with $\rho$ the density, g the gravity magnitude, $\alpha$ thermal
# expansivity, $\Delta_T$ the temperature contrast across the mantle and D the domain height.
# $\eta_0$ is the reference viscosity and $\kappa$ the thermal diffusivity.
# With the parameter values in this and the next section, this leads to
# $Ra = \frac{1 * 1e8 * 1e-6 * 1 * 1^3}{\frac{1}{1*1} * 1e-1} = 100$.
# Note that $\eta_0$ is not the same as the Tosi material model "Reference viscosity".

# The final part is to specify what ASPECT should do with the
# solution once computed at the end of every time step. The
# process of evaluating the solution is called `postprocessing'
# and we choose to compute velocity and temperature statistics,
# statistics about the heat flux through the boundaries of the
# domain, and to generate graphical output files for later
# visualization. These output files are created every time
# a time step crosses time points separated by 0.05. Given
# our start time (0.0) and final time (1.0) this means that
# we will obtain 20 output files.
#
# The statistics file includes the data reported in Tosi et al. (2015):
# - average temperature (temperature statistics)
# - top and bottom Nusselt numbers (heat flux statistics)
# - Vrms over the whole domain (velocity statistics)
# - Vrms along the surface (velocity boundary statistics)
# - Vmax along the surface (velocity boundary statistics)
# - average rate of viscous dissipation (TosiPostprocessor)
# - average rate of work against gravity (TosiPostprocessor)
# - percentage error difference work and dissipation (TosiPostprocessor)
#
# Tosi et al. (2015) also report depth averages; averages for viscosity
# and temperature are produced every 0.05 units of time.
