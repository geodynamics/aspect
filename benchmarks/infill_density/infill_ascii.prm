# This model demonstrates ASPECT's ability to be used to
# model load induced flexure from a topographic feature
# on top of the lithosphere. The model uses the viscoelastic
# material model and is composed of an 'elastic' high viscosity
# lithosphere and a low viscosity mantle beneath the elastic
# lithosphere. A time dependent axisymmetric box load is applied
# to the top boundary using ASCII files, with the center of the load
# at the left boundary of the 2D cartesian model domain. The model
# is run for 120'000 years, which is equivalent to 40*tm:
# tm = eta_m / mu
# eta_m = mantle viscosity
# mu = elastic shear modulus
# tm is the time scale of viscous stress relaxation for the mantle.
# This allows for virtually all stresses in the mantle to be relaxed
# and for the elastic lithosphere to be fully compensating the load.
# The analytic solution for this setup is outlined in the Generic
# Mapping Tools function grdflexure:
# <https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.1/supplements/potential/grdflexure.html>
