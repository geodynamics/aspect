# This parameter file reproduces a 2D analytical benchmark for the build-up
# of stress in an initially unstressed viscoelastic medium subject to a
# constant strain-rate. This benchmark is described in "Robust
# characteristics method for modelling multiphase visco-elasto-plastic
# thermo-mechanical problems" by Gerya and Yuen, 2007, Phys. Earth. Planet.
# Inter., v. 163, p. 83-105. Full details of the benchmark are located in
# section 3.1 and figure 3 of this manuscript.
#
# The analytical solution for viscoelastic stress build-up in
# an incompressible medium with a constant strain-rate is:
#   sigma_ij = 2 * edot_ii * eta * (1 - e^(-mu*t/eta)),
# where sigma_ij is the elastic deviatoric stress tensor, edot_ij is
# the deviatoric strain-rate, eta is the background viscosity, mu is the
# shear modulus and t is time.
#
# Following the conditions described in section 3.1 and figure 3 from
# Gerya and Yuen (2007), a 100x100 km body is subject to a constant
# strain-rate of 1.e-14 s^-1 in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
# Constant deformation is driven by inflow and outflow, respectively,
# on the right and bottom walls. The top and left walls are free-slip.
# The material has a viscosity of 1e22 Pa s and a shear modulus of 1e10 Pa.
# With these values, the analytical solution predicts a horizontal
# or vertical viscoelastic stress magnitude of ~ 200 MPa after 250 Kyr
# of deformation. Significantly, the effective "viscoelastic" viscosity
# is enforced to be constant through time by using a constant time step.
# This is achieved by setting a maximum time step (1000 years) much lower
# than the time step size given by the CFL number of 0.5.
#
# This result can be observed by viewing the compositional field values
# representing the horizontal (ve_stress_xx) or vertical (ve_stress_yy) components
# of the viscoelastic stress tensor. Significantly, the composition is not
# fixed on any boundary in order to prevent the formation of boundary artifacts
# in the compositional fields tracking viscoelastic stresses.
