# This is a test for the melt solver and in particular
# the interafce between regions with melt (coupled Stokes
# Darc flow) and regions with no melt (only Stokes flow).
# The example is taken from
# Arbogast, T., Hesse, M. A., & Taicher, A. L. (2017).
# Mixed Methods for Two-Phase Darcy--Stokes Mixtures of
# Partially Melted Materials with Regions of Zero Porosity.
# SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 39(2), B375-B402.
# (Equation (6.11) and section 6.1.3. Quadratic porosity
# approximation.)

# The parameter theta in the poynomial that represents the
# permeability is set to theta = 0, this means that
# k = k0 phi^2.
# We set k0 = 1.

# Compaction length: L_c = sqrt(k0 mu_s / mu_f)
# rho_r = rho_f - rho_s

# Pressure potentials:
# q_f = p_f - rho_f g z
# q_f(0) = 0 --> p_f(0) = 0
# --> p_f = q_f + rho_f g z

# g = -1
# q_s = p_s - rho_f g z = p_s - z
# q_s = z --> p_s(0) = 0
# --> p_s = q_s + rho_f g z = z + rho_f g z = z (1 + rho_f g)

# q   = phi q_f + (1 - phi) q_s = q_s + phi (q_f - q_s)

# Darcy velocity:
# u = phi (v_f - v_s)
# u = -v_s --> v_f = u / phi + v_s
