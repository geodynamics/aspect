# This parameter file modifies the 2D benchmark 'viscoelastic_bending_beam'.
# It has been modified to model a much larger beam, and to have an open top
# and bottom boundary to allow the inelastic, low viscosity fluid surrounding the beam to
# be more easily displaced while the beam flexes.
#
# The benchmark examines bending of a viscoelastic beam surrounded by a less dense
# and viscous (inelastic) fluid. Gravitational forces drive initial bending
# (elastic strain) of the beam. The analytic solution is from Geodynamics 3rd Edition by
# Turcotte and Schubert, Chapter 3.10 (eq. 3.85 for flexure and 3.86 for stress).
# Models have been tested for deflections that are no greater than half the thickness of
# the beam. More flexure could potentially lead to a breakdown of the fit since the analytic
# solution assumes small deflection relative to the thickness.
