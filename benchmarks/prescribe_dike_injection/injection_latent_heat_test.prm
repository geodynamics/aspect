# This is a 2D test model of dike injection function to determine that the
# latent heating term in the energy equation corresponding to injection 
# terms in the Stokes equations is working prepoerly.

# Material is injected in the left half of the domain with a rate that
# corresponds to a velocity divergence of 1e-15 1/s and can flow
# out through the right boundary. This corresponds to a linear velocity 
# increase from 0 to 500 m * 1e-15 1/s = 5e-13 m/s in the right half
# of the domain.

# In the injection area, the latent heat release upon crystallization 
# (H_crys) and associated with injection melt ((T_inj-T)*rho*Cp, where
# T_inj the temperature of injected melt, T, rho, Cp are temperature,
# density and specific heat) is:
#
#   (H_crys + (T_inj - T) * rho * Cp) * injection rate
#   (1e11 + (2e5 - 0) * 1000 * 1000) J/m^3 * 1e-15 1/s 
#   =  3e-4 J/m^3/s

# The latent heat release associated with this is 
#
#   injection_ratio*latent heat * time step * injection rate
#   1.0 * 1e11 J/m^3  * 1e10 s    * 1e-15 1/s      = 1e6 J/m^3
#
# This leads to a temperature change of 1 K (when devided by the density 
# and specific heat).

# Material is injected with a temperature of 2e5 K, which in combination
# with the injection rate of 1e-15 1/s and the time step of 1e10 s leads
# to a temperature change of 2 K.
# This means the final temperature in the left half of the domain is 3 K.
