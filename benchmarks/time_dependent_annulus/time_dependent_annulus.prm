# This is the setup of the time dependent annular flow benchmark
# from Section 5 of
#
# Gassmoeller, Lokavarapu, Bangerth, Puckett (2019):
# Evaluating the Accuracy of Hybrid Finite Element/Particle-In-Cell
# Methods for Modeling Incompressible Stokes Flow. Geophys. J. Int.
# submitted.
#
# It features a spherical annulus with a circular flow and a
# time-independent analytical, but a time-dependent numerical solution,
# which allows to quantify how errors in the advection equation
# influence the accuracy of the Stokes equation. In this example
# the benchmark uses particles to carry density, but it can be
# used for other advection methods as well.
