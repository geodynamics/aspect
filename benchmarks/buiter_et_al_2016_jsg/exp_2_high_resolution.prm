# This parameter file reproduces the unstable wedge experiment 2 from
# Buiter et al., 2016, JSG.
# Experiment 2 tests how an unstable subcritical wedge deforms to reach the
# critical taper solution. Horizontal layers of sand have 10 cm shortening
# by inward movement of a mobile wall with a velocity of 2.5 cm/hour. Both
# the base and the surface are horizontal and the “wedge” is thus in the
# unstable field. This experiment builds a thrust wedge through a combination
# of mainly in-sequence forward and backward thrusting. Deformation starts by
# forming a pop-up structure near the high viscosity rigid indenter.
