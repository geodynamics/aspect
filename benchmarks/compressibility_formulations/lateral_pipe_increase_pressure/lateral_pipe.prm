# This is a benchmark to illustrate the effect of different formulations
# of compressibility. It starts from a simple lateral pipe flow model.
# There is no prescribed velocity and one end of the pipe is left open.
# Then the pressure at the open end is contiuously increased over time,
# which should lead to a compression of the material in the pipe.
# This effect can not be captured by all common compressibility
# approximations except the projected density approximation if it
# used the full (instead of the adiabatic) pressure.
