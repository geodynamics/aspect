# This is a benchmark to illustrate the effect of different formulations
# of compressibility. It starts from a simple lateral pipe flow model,
# in which material enters a lateral pipe with a prescribed velocity.
# Due to internal heating the material expands and the velocity
# changes to conserve mass.
