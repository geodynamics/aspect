# This is a benchmark to illustrate the effect of different formulations
# of compressibility. It starts from a simple lateral pipe flow model,
# in which material enters a vertical pipe with a prescribed velocity.
# Due to increasing temperature at the boundary a density gradient is
# advected into the model.
