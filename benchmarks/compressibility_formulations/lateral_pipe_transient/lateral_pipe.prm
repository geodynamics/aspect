# This is a benchmark to illustrate the effect of different formulations
# of compressibility. It starts from a simple lateral pipe flow model.
# There is no prescribed velocity, and one end of the pipe is open.
# Due to internal heating the material in the pipe heats up, expands,
# and creates a flow out of the open end of the pipe. The parameters
# for this benchmark were chosen so that an analytical solution for
# the mass flow out of the pipe exists.
