# This is a benchmark to illustrate the effect of different formulations
# of compressibility. It starts from a simple downward pipe flow model,
# in which material enters a vertical pipe with a prescribed velocity.
# Due to gravity and pressure the material compresses and the velocity
# changes to conserve mass.
